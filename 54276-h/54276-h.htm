<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>This paper may be regarded as a continuation of the Cubomedusan
studies pursued by Dr. F. S. Conant while in Jamaica, in 1896 and 1897,
with the Johns Hopkins Marine Laboratory. His systematic and
anatomical results have since been published as his Dissertation (“The
Cubomedusæ”) by this University. Conant described this paper as
Part I, hoping soon to add a second part on the physiology and the
embryology, for which he had some notes and material at hand.
Returning, however, to Jamaica with the laboratory, in 1897, he
continued his physiological experiments, and preserved material for
histological purposes. Upon the untimely death of Conant, his material
and notes were placed in my hands by Professor Brooks, to whom I
here take the opportunity of expressing my appreciation and sincere
thanks for the honor thus conferred and for the many favors received.</p>

<p>In this paper I shall note at some length Conant’s physiological
results and append his notes. I shall also add my results on the
histology of the eyes and the sensory clubs in general, with some few
facts on the histology of the tentacles. The embryology will be
reserved for a future paper.</p>

<p>The forms used in the physiological experiments were Charybdea
Xaymacana, one of the two species (see Literature <a href="#bookV">V, a and b</a>)
first found and described by Conant; Aurelia aurita; Polyclonia and
Cassiopœa. The greater number of Conant’s notes are on Charybdea,
and were left by him just as taken at the time of experimenting.
Many of these notes are highly interesting and in the main fit in
well with Romanes’<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#bookI">[I]</a></span> and Eimer’s<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#bookIV">[IV]</a></span> results.</p>

<p>Dr. Conant’s work on Charybdea, in 1897, was wholly done at
Port Antonio, Jamaica. At first Conant had only varying success in
obtaining Charybdea, scouring the harbor and neighboring water at
all hours, only to obtain but few specimens. It was on the forenoon
of August 7th, while we were dredging at the head of East Harbor
with a steam launch, that many Charybdeæ were brought up in the
dredge. This gave Conant a clue to their whereabouts and to the
means of obtaining them, and from that time on he was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
obtain them in abundance. His first physiological experiments were
begun on August 4th and continued thereafter at intervals of several
days until his departure from Jamaica on September 6th.</p>

<p>Dr. Conant usually performed his experiments during the second
half of the forenoon, after the animals had stood for a few hours in
the laboratory.</p>

<p>The building that was rented at Port Antonio for a laboratory
had, in the basement, a photographer’s dark-room, which was of great
service to Conant in his experiments.</p>

<p>The experiments on Aurelia, in 1897, were also performed at
Port Antonio, between August 6th and 9th. The experiments on
Cassiopœa were probably made at Port Antonio, where specimens
were occasionally obtained.</p>

<p>The notes on Aurelia and Polyclonia, in 1896, were taken at Port
Henderson, between May 12th and June 27th.</p>

<p>In his notes Conant speaks of Polyclonia and Cassiopœa. It is
at present undetermined whether he really had both forms or whether
he uses the two names for the same form. It seems likely that in
1896 he thought the form to be Polyclonia, while for some reason,
in 1897, he supposed it to be Cassiopœa. I have examined several
specimens of these medusæ brought from Port Antonio and find that
they all have twelve marginal bodies and twenty-four radial canals,
according to which (<a href="#bookV">V, Haeckel’s System</a>), they should be Polyclonia.
Conant, however, speaks of removing sixteen marginal bodies, which
seems to indicate that he had Cassiopœa. A careful classification
of this form of medusæ found about Jamaica seems to be a desideratum.
I suppose, however, that for our purpose in this paper it will make
little difference which name is used, the two forms being so similar
in form and structure. I have, therefore, decided to retain both the
names used by Conant.</p>

<p>For the complete anatomy of Charybdea the reader is referred
to Dr. Conant’s dissertation, “The Cubomedusæ” (<a href="#book8b">8b</a>), or the <cite>Johns
Hopkins University Circulars</cite> (<a href="#book8a">8a</a>), both published by the Johns
Hopkins Press. But, for the convenience of those who may be less
familiar with Cubomedusan anatomy, the following brief summary
of the anatomy of Charybdea is given:</p>

<p>The Cubomedusæ, as the name implies, approximate cubes, with
their tentacles (four in Charybdea) arranged at the four corners of
the lower face of the cube. These tentacles are said to lie in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
interradii. Half way between any two points of attachment of the
pedalia (the basal portions of the tentacles) and a little above the
margin of the bell (cube), in a niche, hang the sensory clubs, one on
each side, four in all. Each sensory club hangs in a niche of the
exumbrella and is attached by a small peduncle whose axial canal
is in connection with one of the four stomach-pockets and in the
club proper forms an ampulla-like enlargement.</p>

<p>Each club is said to lie in a perradius, and, like the tentacles,
belongs to the subumbrella. This is shown by the course of the
vascular lamellæ, bands of cells that, stretching through the jelly
from the endoderm to the ectoderm all around the margin, form the
line of division between sub- and exumbrella.</p>

<p>Each club has six eyes. Two of these on the middle line of the
club facing inwards are called the proximal and distal complex eyes,
to distinguish them from the four simple eyes that are disposed
laterally, two on each side of the line of the two complex eyes. All of
these eyes look inwards into the bell cavity through a thin transparent
membrane of the subumbrella. Besides the eyes and the ampulla
already mentioned, a concretion fills the lowermost part of the club,
and a group of large cells, having a network-like structure and called
network cells by Conant, fill the uppermost part of the club between
the proximal complex eye and the attachment of the club to its
peduncle (<a href="#plate2">Plate II, Fig. 13</a>). What is evidently nerve tissue, fibers and
ganglion cells, fills the rest of the club, with two groups of large
ganglion cells disposed laterally from the network cells. A sensory
(flagellate) epithelium covers the club.</p>

<p>Most Cubomedusæ, among them Charybdea, have a velarium
(comparable to the velum of the Hydromedusæ), a membrane of
tissue that extends inwards at right angles all around the margin.
This velarium, like a velum, has a central opening through which
the water is expelled from the bell-cavity when the animal pulsates.
In the perradii and in the angle between the velarium and the body
wall, are the frenula, which give support to the velarium much like
brackets support a shelf, except that here the brackets are above the
shelf instead of below.</p>

<p>In the upper part of the bell is the stomach, with the phacelli in
its interradii, and continued ventrally into the manubrium, or the
proboscis. The cavity of the stomach is continued in the perradii
through the four gastric ostia into the four stomach pockets, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
occupy the sides of the bell and extend to the margin. Immediately
below the gastric ostia, and in the bell cavity, are the suspensoria, one
in each perradius. These support the floor of the stomach much as the
frenula support the velarium, except that the suspensoria are placed
under the shelf (to continue Conant’s figure) and not above it as are
the frenula.</p>

<p>A nerve ring, underneath the epithelium of the subumbrella,
passes from near the origin of each pedalium at the margin to the
origin of the peduncles of the sensory clubs, a little above the margin,
giving off a branch to each club. Eight ganglia are found in the
course of this nerve. The four pedal ganglia lie near the bases of
the pedalia, and are hence interradial; the four radial ganglia lie
near the bases of the peduncles of the clubs, and are perradial. A
small nerve, radial nerve, can be traced a short distance upwards
from each radial ganglion. Underlying the epithelium of the frenula
and the suspensoria are ganglion cells and nerve fibers in larger
numbers than elsewhere (excepting the ganglia mentioned) in the
subumbrella. Otherwise, ganglion cells and nerve fibers underlie the
epithelium of the subumbrella, including the inner surface of the
velarium, as also do muscle fibers, except in the perradii and in the
region of the nerve, where the latter become interrupted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Charybdea.</span></h3>

<p class="section"><i>Light and Darkness</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp1">1-9</a>, <a href="#exp10">10</a>, <a href="#exp33">33</a>, <a href="#exp34">34</a>.&mdash;As already stated
in the Introduction, a part of Conant’s experiments were performed
in a photographer’s dark-room, with the animals in a deep glass jar.
In the dark a fair proportion of the animals became nearly quiescent
on the bottom, but upon lighting a lamp many started up immediately,
while others took a longer time to come to the surface and swim.
These experiments were tried a number of times and on different
occasions with very similar results. Some medusæ, however, tried
immediately after being brought in, seemed not to react so well upon
being placed in the dark-room, nor would they become quiescent.
This, probably, was due to the fact that the animals had not yet
recovered from the effects of being caught and placed in new
surroundings. (Experiments <a href="#exp1">1</a>, <a href="#exp2">2</a>, <a href="#exp3">3</a>.)</p>

<p>Other experiments (<a href="#exp4">4-8</a>, <a href="#exp33">33</a>, <a href="#exp34">34</a>) were tried by carrying the jar
with the animals from the weaker light of a room into the more
intense light of outdoors or into direct sunlight. The usual result
was an inhibition of pulsation and a settling to the bottom, while
the medusæ immediately became active again upon returning with
them to the room. These results were so marked that no doubts can
be entertained as to their cause, though some exceptions occurred in
which animals placed in the sun continued to swim on the surface
or soon recovered pulsation. In some experiments, too, no animals
responded to the inhibitory stimulus of the brighter light or all very
soon recovered. (See, however, Temperature.)</p>

<p>Reducing the light by placing a coat over the jar produced
the same effect in some experiments (<a href="#exp8">8</a>, <a href="#exp9">9</a>, <a href="#exp10">10</a>) as did reducing the
light in other ways, while removing the coat produced the same
effect as exposure to brighter light. In these instances it appears
to be the transition from weaker to stronger light that inhibits
pulsation, rather than the actual intensity of the light; and <i>vice versa</i>.
It must be noted, too, that when left for some time in any one place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the animals changed, some coming to the surface and others going
to the bottom.</p>

<p>These experiments show beyond doubt that Charybdea is sensitive
to light, and that it is moderate light that stimulates the animals to
activity, while darkness and strong light inhibit activity. While the
individual exceptions, as Conant himself suggests, are well explained
on the supposition of individual diversity, yet it appears that other
conditions, such as the time of day, temperature, etc., may have been
responsible for some of the exceptional experiments in which no
animals responded as expected.</p>

<p>While light of any intensity seems to have stimulated Romanes’<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#bookI">[I]</a></span>
Sarsia and Tiaropsis (Hydromedusæ) to activity, we note that it
is moderate light that stimulates Charybdea. This fact is evidently
correlated with the circumstance that Charybdea usually lives upon
or near the bottom.</p>

<p>It may further be added in regard to Romanes’ Tiaropsis
polydiademata, that when it was suddenly exposed to light it went
into a spasm preceded by a long latent period during which there
was a “summation of stimulating influence” in the ganglia. Sarsiæ
would congregate toward the source of light and in general were
more active in light than in the dark, while sudden darkness often
inhibited a swimming bout. Romanes proves for Sarsia that
the marginal bodies are the seat of luminous stimulation and
that it is the light rays and not heat rays that stimulate. He
also remarks that he has obtained similar results on the covered-eyed
(Scyphomedusæ) medusæ, namely, that they respond to luminous
stimulation.</p>

<p>It may here be of interest to note a few observations made by
myself at Wood’s Holl, Mass., on a beautiful Olindiad, which is
abundant in the Eelpond at the above place. I found that in a
room, in the ordinary light of evening, the animals swam actively;
but the moment the electric light was turned on they stopped swimming
and settled to the bottom or attached themselves to a branch
of some weed or stem suspended in the water. This was the result
in every trial. It is found, further, to be little active during the
brighter parts of the day, when one must dip quite deep with a net
in order to obtain it. A similar observation is also made by
Murbach<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#bookII">[II]</a></span>, who further states that this medusa may be deceived
into laying its eggs by placing it in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot help but remark how analogous is the behavior of
medusæ, in respect to light and darkness, to the behavior of many
of the higher animals,&mdash;and medusæ are among the most lowly
organized of the animal creation.</p>

<p>Were one to conclude from the behavior of Charybdea in light
and darkness in the laboratory, that it remained on or near the
bottom in the daytime but became more active near or at the
surface evenings, nights and early mornings, one would probably not
be far from the truth. Dr. Conant, while towing near the bottom
with a weighted net, in water four to five feet (1.2-1.5 m.) deep not far
from shore and deeper farther out, found Charybdea in abundance
mornings and afternoons, but very few in the evening. In the
evening some few were usually taken in the surface tow. (See Introduction,
Occurrence and Activity.)</p>

<p>Again, who knows but that Charybdea is active during the day,
on the bottom where it was dredged (the light there would only be
moderate), and quiet at night. This supposition would seem to be
true, at least, for those forms of Cubomedusæ that live in deep
water. We can hardly suppose that they should regularly rise to
the surface from great depths and become active. This much we do
know that bright light inhibits Charybdea’s activities, while it
probably would not be active in perfect darkness.</p>

<p>I do not know just what interpretation to put upon Conant’s
finding Charybdea at Port Henderson at the surface during the
early part of the forenoon, before the sea-breeze roughened the water
(“Cubomedusæ” p. 7). This fact hardly fits in with my conclusions
above. Perhaps Charybdea’s habits vary with its habitat.</p>

<p>Finally, while I find no experimental evidence in Conant’s notes
about what parts of Charybdea are sensitive to light, yet it would
seem preposterous, from histological evidence and from Romanes’
results on Sarsia, to doubt that the eyes of the marginal bodies are
the seat of this stimulation.</p>

<p>Dr. Conant further experimented by cutting off certain organs
and parts from the Cubomedusan bell. These excisions consisted
chiefly in cutting out the concretions of the sensory clubs, cutting off
the whole club, eliminating a part or whole of the margin and the
velarium, cutting the bell into sectors, excising the stomach and
parts connected with it, and other parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p class="section"><i>Concretions</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp10">10</a>, <a href="#exp11">11</a>.&mdash;The four concretions were
removed from each of four animals. Two of these (Experiments <a href="#exp10">10</a>,
and another (X), not appended, to save space) seemed to be little if
at all affected by the operation. One of the two (<a href="#exp10">10</a>) swam actively,
at first up and down more changeably than those intact, but later
mostly near the surface. The other one also swam actively and
showed nothing to indicate weakened sense-perception. The other
two (<a href="#exp11">11</a>) did not stand the operation well, as Conant remarks, and
immediately went to the bottom, where they remained, one swimming,
while eight hours later one was still in good condition.</p>

<p>Several attempts with stronger light by removing the coat from
the jar made no difference in the behavior of <a href="#exp10">10</a>; it continued to
swim as heretofore. Upon a final trial, however, with removing the
coat, it went to the bottom, thus showing a possible reaction to light;
but when next seen it was keeping to the bottom.</p>

<p>That the concretions should function as organs of light sensation,
as the first of the above animals might seem to indicate, I believe is
out of the question.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> The fact, too, that this same animal (<a href="#exp10">10</a>), together
with another (X), swam actively, immediately changing their course
upon coming to the surface, in reality behaving quite as normal
animals, hardly permits us to conclude from the behavior of the
other two (<a href="#exp11">11</a>) that the concretions function directly as organs of
equilibrium or space relations. May these concretions not function
simply as weights for keeping the sensory clubs with their eyes
properly suspended? Since these concretions lie at the lowermost part
of the clubs and in closed sacs and unsupported by cilia, it would
seem that the above suggestion as to their being weights is not
improbable. Direct observation (Experiment <a href="#exp20">20</a>) by Conant shows,
furthermore, that the clubs always hang with a tendency for the
concretions to be lowermost, regardless of the position of the animal.</p>

<p>Again, while they may function as weights, as just explained,
the fact that the epithelium of the clubs is flagellated (a flagellum,
continued as a nerve fiber, to each cell&mdash;see Histology), the supposition
lies near that these flagella are the ones influenced by the concretions
as the clubs bear against one side of the sensory niche or the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
A somewhat similar view seems to be held by other observers and
is noted by Lang in his text-book (“The outer epithelium of the
auditory body carries the auditory hairs”). It seems, then, that in
functioning as weights for suspending the clubs, they may also serve
at the same time for making the pressure of the club against the
niche greater than if they were absent, and thus in part serve in
equilibrium. On this supposition we should expect, furthermore, that
after the removal of the concretions the animal would be little,
if at all, affected, since the clubs themselves, without the concretions,
would still be of sufficient weight to be influenced by gravity and thus
to bear against the walls of the sensory niche. It must be noted,
however, that Conant’s experiments upon equilibration in Charybdea are
negative. Also, that Charybdea has any auditory sense is negatived by
two attempts of Conant’s with a violin&mdash;one attempt with the violin
near the animals, and another with it in contact with the dish. (From
an unpublished note.) Hence, some other word such as sensory or
equilibrating should perhaps be substituted for “auditory” in the
above quotation.</p>

<p>Removing the concretions from Aurelia gave negative results very
similar to those on Charybdea. (Experiment <a href="#exp42">42</a>.)</p>

<p class="section"><i>Sensory Clubs</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp12">12-19</a>, <a href="#exp20">20</a>, <a href="#exp24">24</a>.&mdash;The entire sensory clubs
were removed from a number of animals. A paralysis of pulsation
followed by a rapid recovery was the usual result. In some instances,
however, there was no paralysis, while in others no recovery followed
paralysis. This is true in a general way whether one club only or all
were removed. While no permanent paralysis followed the removal
of one or two clubs, yet permanent paralysis did occur after the
removal of a third club, as, of course, also after the removal of a
fourth. It is evident, too, that as the removal of the clubs progressed
recovery seemed to be weaker after each cutting, except in one case
when pulsation seemed to be quickened after the removal of a second
club. The pulsations after recovery seemed to be not so strong and
regular, often quite feeble, and in one instance in groups. Pieces of
tissue with a club attached and pulsating regularly, ceased pulsating
after removal of the club, in one instance, however, still giving
occasional contractions.</p>

<p>These results are quite the same as those of Romanes<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#bookI">[I]</a></span> on
Aurelia, Cyanæa, etc., and of Eimer<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#bookIV">[IV]</a></span> on Aurelia, Rhizostoma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Cotylorhyza, etc.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> In these forms Romanes sometimes obtained
complete paralysis after the removal of the sensory clubs only, as also
after the removal of the whole margin, though this was not marked
in Aurelia. In Cyanæa and other forms motor centers seemed to
be more abundant than in Aurelia, so that paralysis was oftener
followed by recovery. He concludes that while the principal motor
centers reside in the lithocysts, other centers doubtless exist that
may function vicariously, but that the centers of the margin are
more definitely limited to the marginal bodies in the Scyphomedusæ
than in the Hydromedusæ, in which the whole margin seems to be
replete with centers. He feels positive, furthermore, that no motor
centers exist in Aurelia’s margin outside of the marginal bodies
(lithocysts). Eimer’s results are essentially the same as Romanes’,
so that for a more detailed comparison of the two, Romanes’ works
should be consulted.</p>

<p>Romanes’ conclusion for the Hydromedusæ is that the motor
centers are not so definitely localized in the marginal bodies, but
in the margin generally, the excision of the marginal bodies alone
producing only partial paralysis, as would also the removal of the
margin from between the marginal bodies, but not so marked.
For the Hydromedusæ he concludes, then, that all the centers of
spontaneity are definitely localized in the margin, but not limited
to the marginal bodies. To this he mentions one exception, namely,
<i>Staurophora laciniata</i>, in which another center is found near the
margin and two others in two opposite arms of the proboscis.</p>

<p>I made the remark in an abstract (<a href="#bookVI">VI</a>) on Conant’s notes that
Romanes did not obtain recovery of pulsation after removal of all
the lithocysts in Aurelia. As noted above, he did obtain recovery, so
that Conant’s results on Charybdea and also Aurelia (see Polyclonia
and Aurelia) are quite in agreement with Romanes.</p>

<p>The paralysis following the removal of the clubs in Charybdea is
evidently, primarily, the result of a loss of a part of its nervous
mechanism (motor centers), and, secondarily, of nervous shock, and
points to the existence of a definite nervous mechanism in the
clubs. The histological evidence is here, as usual, corroborative of the
physiological.</p>

<p>Another interesting phenomenon observed after the removal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one or all of the clubs was the strange behavior of the proboscis.
This would reach from side to side, expanding and contracting its
lips as if trying to grasp something. This behavior is very similar to
that of the proboscis of <i>Tiaropsis indicans</i> when Romanes stimulated
any part of its subumbrella, or of <i>Limnocodium sorbii</i>, a little fresh-water
medusa, when he stimulated its margin or the region of the
radial canals. (Ib., p. 242.)</p>

<p>I may add that I observed a very similar movement of the
proboscis of the Olindiad, before mentioned. When I pulled off pieces
of its gonads by means of quick jerks, with a small forceps, it would
continually reach toward the injured part of its subumbrella. This
medusa is generally quite active with its proboscis and can occasionally
be seen to reach with it.</p>

<p>Romanes states in one place that the proboscis is not affected by the
excision of the margin. This is evidently not the case in Charybdea,
in which excision of the sensory clubs (which really belong to the
margin&mdash;see “Cubomedusæ”) decidedly stimulated the proboscis to
active movements. This, furthermore, points to the marginal bodies
as being organs of considerable importance in giving information in
the life of Charybdea. In Romanes’ Sarsia and other medusæ, however,
the proboscis did respond to the stimulation of the tentacles and the
marginal bodies, as also would the bell respond to a stimulation of
the proboscis (manubrium), thus showing a reflex nervous connection
between these regions of the bell, similar to that described for
Charybdea.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Velarium and Frenula</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp29">29</a>, <a href="#exp30">30</a>, <a href="#exp41">41c</a>.&mdash;“The power
of originating contractions” to use Conant’s own words, “evidently
resides in the velarium or in ganglion cells of the frenula, just
as it does in the proboscis and the floor of the stomach.” Isolated
pieces of the velarium contracted by themselves as did the whole
velarium when all other tissue had been removed. An isolated velarium
with the margin and the pedalia attached gave irregular contractions.
When the pedalia with the <em>interradial ganglia</em> were removed it still
contracted; and when all the other tissue was cut off contractions
continued.</p>

<p>Cutting the velarium caused the <em>pedalia</em> to be strongly contracted
inwards so that the tentacles were brought inside the bell. Cutting
away the velarium did not interfere with the pulsations of the bell,
but progress was much retarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Cutting the frenula caused the pedalia to contract but seemed
not to affect the ability to swim. Comparing the velarium of the
Cubomedusæ with the velum of the Hydromedusæ, I recall no
observations similar to the ones here noted, though it seems that the
two may have quite similar functions. It seems somewhat probable
that the velum, and also the velarium, may function in obtaining
food,&mdash;and this besides their function in swimming. Their probable
function in swimming, as is well known, is evidently to narrow the
mouth of the bell and thus to cause the water to be forced out in a
smaller but more rapid stream, giving the animal a steady and more
prolonged movement through the water at every contraction of the
bell. In regard to taking food, I observed that a small crustacean, in
the process of being swallowed by an Olindiad, seemed to be held by
the velum being firmly contracted about it while the proboscis was
working itself over the crustacean. It would seem, furthermore, that
my supposition is supported for Charybdea by the fact that the
pedalia and tentacles were contracted so as to be brought inside the
bell when the velarium was cut. The stimulus of cutting the velarium
may be comparable to a stimulus from some object touching it, and
thus cause the pedalia and tentacles to come reflexly to aid in
capturing or holding the object, a fish, crustacean, or such, to be
captured.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Pedalia, Interradial Ganglia, Tentacles</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp15">15</a>, <a href="#exp23">23</a>, <a href="#exp27">27-31</a>,
<a href="#exp41">41b</a>.&mdash;When the pedalia were removed, the power of the animal to guide
itself was completely gone. When one pedalium was cut the others
contracted, while stroking the outer edge of the pedalia, touching the
sensory clubs, or sharply pricking the subumbrella, often produced the
same result. (See also Nerve.) The upper part of the subumbrella
seemed not so sensitive and more seldom produced the reflex of the
pedalia, while the base of the stomach did not give it at all. Stroking
the outer edge of the pedalia of <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i>, the second of the
two species of Cubomedusæ described by Conant, also caused the pedalia
to be contracted inwards. I may note here that the muscle fibers under
the ectoderm of the pedalia are specially well developed at and near the
inner and outer edges, both in Charybdea and Tripedalia. On the
flattened sides of the pedalia the muscle fibers are fewer.</p>

<p>When the pedalia were cut off far enough up to remove the
interradial ganglia, coördination was not affected and the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
could pulsate well enough but with little progress. (See above under
Velarium and Frenula.)</p>

<p>An isolated tentacle is capable of squirming contractions, and
when stimulated at either end, it would contract wholly or in part
only.</p>

<p>The pedalia, then, it would seem, serve also as a steering apparatus,
for which they are admirably fitted, considering their blade-like
thinness.</p>

<p>Considering, now, the reflexes noted under this head and the
preceding one, we find that there is an intimate nervous connection
between the velarium and frenula, subumbrella, sensory clubs, nerve,
and a single pedalium, on the one hand, and the pedalia on the other
hand. This is born out fully, furthermore, by the histological evidence&mdash;(See
Introduction and “Cubomedusæ”). Considering the subumbral
plexus of ganglion cells and fibers, including the velarium and the
frenula, which is in connection with the nerve ring and this again
with the sensory clubs and the interradial ganglia at the bases of
the pedalia, we have a basis for these reflexes. While Conant failed
to demonstrate nerves (“Cubomedusæ”) from the interradial ganglia
to the pedalia, yet, that a nervous connection exists between the
pedalia and the bell is well shown by his physiological experiments.
I have, furthermore, demonstrated ganglion cells under the ectoderm
of the tentacles (see Histology).</p>

<p>Romanes obtained quite similar results in the Hydromedusæ. He
found that when a tentacle of Sarsia was slightly stimulated, it alone
would contract, but when it was more strongly stimulated the other
tentacles also would respond as also the manubrium. I find no evidence
in Conant’s notes of any such response of the manubrium of Charybdea,
except when the clubs were cut off.</p>

<p>The reflex obtained on stimulating the subumbrella of Charybdea,
when the pedalia would contract, is somewhat different from that
obtained by Romanes, who found that the most sensitive part of the
subumbrella in producing a reflex of the margin was at the junction
of the manubrium to the bell and that the subumbrella below this
point did not give the reflex.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Stomach, Suspensoria, Proboscis, Subumbrella</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp12">12</a>, <a href="#exp18">18</a>,
<a href="#exp19">19</a>, <a href="#exp24">24-26</a>, <a href="#exp29">29</a>, <a href="#exp31">31</a>.&mdash;The proboscis and the stomach with the phacelli
when cut out, contracted with or without the lips removed. The
isolated lips also contracted (twitched).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Pieces of the sides connected only with the stomach and suspensoria,
or with the margin (Experiment <a href="#exp47">47</a> (?)) twitched spontaneously,
but seldom did so when these were removed. In one instance the
whole side was cut out so as to exclude the radial ganglion but still
connected with a portion of the suspensorium. This pulsated, or
contracted, but on being halved transversely, the lower half ceased to
contract while the upper half connected with the suspensorium,
continued to contract.</p>

<p>Cutting off the whole stomach end of the animal excited to very
rapid pulsations of the remaining part, with the stream of water
stronger out the aboral end than past the velarium.</p>

<p>Conant says, “It seems I get no good evidence of the subumbrella
without connection with special nerve centers being able to contract
by itself.” The piece in which he did get contractions he suspects
may have been intimately associated with some part of the frenula
or the suspensoria. In Polyclonia no such doubt exists, for small
pieces of subumbrella were seen to contract. A small piece of
subumbrella of Charybdea with a sensory club attached could contract
by itself.</p>

<p>From the above it would seem that a center capable of inciting
to contractions resided in the suspensoria as well as in the sensory
clubs, and this may be one of the centers that becomes potent upon
the removal of the clubs. This is further supported by Conant’s
observation (Introduction and “Cubomedusæ”) that an extra large
number of ganglion cells is found under the epithelium of the
suspensoria. A somewhat similarly located center of spontaneity
described by Romanes for <i>Staurophora laciniata</i> (Hydromedusa) has
already been noted.</p>

<p>As to the rapid pulsations of the bell after cutting out the
stomach end, this also is similar to Romanes’ results on Aurelia and
other Scyphomedusæ, when he cut off parts of the manubrium or an
aboral ring out of the bell. In these instances, however, Romanes
soon obtained a slackening of the rhythm following the temporary
acceleration. The temporary acceleration he attributes to the stimulus
of cutting, and the slackening to a lack of some afferent stimulus
from the removed tissue. Conant obtained the same results on
Polyclonia by removing the oral arms (see Polyclonia) but says
nothing about a slackening of the rhythm in Charybdea. I believe
the increased rhythm in Charybdea was in part due to the decreased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
amount of labor necessary to force the water out of two openings
instead of one, namely, past the velarium. Just how much this
observation bears upon Romanes’ theory of rhythmic contraction,
that the rhythm is due to an alternate exhaustion and recovery of
the contractile tissue, as opposed to the ganglionic theory of rhythm
of physiologists, one does not wish to speculate much. Yet, I feel
that the observation rather supports this theory. The tissue having
to do less work, would become less exhausted at each contraction and
require less time for recovery and hence have a more rapid rhythm.</p>

<p>I here sum up Romanes’ theory in a few words. The ganglia
liberate a constant and comparatively weak stimulus, one perhaps
about minimal. This stimulus sets off the contractile tissue; but as
the tissue contracts and becomes exhausted the constant stimulus
becomes, in relation to it, sub-minimal, and it does not contract
again until it has recovered and the stimulus is again strong enough
to set it off. The ganglionic theory of rhythmic contraction supposes
that the ganglia liberate stimuli to the contractile tissue at successive
intervals. Romanes had this theory suggested to him by the rhythmic
contractions he succeeded in obtaining by subjecting deganglionated
bells to a continuous but weak faradic stimulus, or by placing them
into weakly acidulated water, or into 5 per cent. glycerine. Romanes
claims that his theory better explains muscular tonus and the
contraction of involuntary muscle. He does not, however, hold this
theory to the exclusion of the ganglionic theory, since only too often
does he speak in terms of the latter. He further brings in his
support the fact that the frog’s tongue, in which no ganglia have
been demonstrated, can be made to contract rhythmically when
subjected to a weak and continuous stimulus. He also calls attention
to the rhythmic contractions seen in the Protozoa, the snail’s heart,
etc. Finally, physiologists are much inclined to explain the rhythmic
contraction of the heart and other involuntary muscles, in part, at
least, as due to a property of the contractile tissue.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Margin, Radial Ganglia, Nerve</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp21">21-23</a>, <a href="#exp30">30</a>.&mdash;Complete
removal of the margin did not stop pulsation; but the
removal of the radial ganglia stopped it permanently. While this
experiment seems to have been tried only once, yet, taking into
consideration the results of other operations, it would seem that the
principal centers of spontaneity reside in these ganglia. (It should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
here be remembered that the interradial ganglia were probably
removed at the removing of the margin.)</p>

<p>Cutting the nerve in the eight adradii caused the <em>pedalia</em> to bend
inwards at right angles to their normal position but did not in the
least affect the coördination of the sides. When, however, the sides
were cut in the eight adradii to the base of the stomach, coördination
for the main part ceased, and each side pulsated in its own
rhythm.</p>

<p>I have said that the principal centers of spontaneity reside in the
radial ganglia. Upon further thought this hardly seems warranted.
No doubt, among the principal motor centers must be placed the
ganglionic masses of the clubs, and the radial ganglia, together
with the homologous interradial ganglia, represent centers of equal
value. I speak of these two sets of ganglia as homologous, since
strictly speaking, they both belong to the margin, and the clubs at
whose bases they lie probably represent modified tentacles. Conant’s
experiments leave us in the dark as to the function of these ganglia.
Next in order, it would seem, are the ganglion cells in the suspensoria,
as is suggested by the contractions of an isolated side with a portion
of a suspensorium attached. (See previous head.) While we have
seen that the frenula and the velarium can contract by themselves,
yet, I find no evidence that these can impart their contractions
to any adjacent tissue.</p>

<p>Conant’s results on cutting the nerve eight times and then
continuing the cuts to the base of the stomach are quite the same as
Romanes and Eimer obtained upon Aurelia. Romanes, however,
concludes that in his Sarsia, Tiaropsis, etc., coördination was broken
when only short incisions were made in the margin. Charybdea
appears, then, to agree with Aurelia rather than with the Hydromedusæ.
Yet, since Romanes at first obtained similar results to those
of Charybdea on Sarsia, but on further experimenting concluded that
coördination had really been destroyed at the first cutting, we cannot
speak with certainty that coördination had not been destroyed in
Charybdea before the cuts had been continued to the base of the
stomach. I say not with certainty, because the injury to the bell
being slight, coördination may have been maintained on the principle
of a simultaneously (simultaneous for the octants) alternate exhaustion
and recovery of the contractile tissue on the principle of Romanes’
theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="section"><i>Stimulation.</i>&mdash;Romanes found when he stimulated a deganglionated
bell of a Hydromedusa, that it responded by a single contraction,
while that of a Scyphomedusa responded with several quite rhythmic
contractions. Charybdea in this respect agrees with the Scyphomedusæ.
Romanes’ results were also verified on Aurelia. (Experiments
<a href="#exp12">12c</a>, <a href="#exp15">15</a>, <a href="#exp50">50</a>, <a href="#exp51">51</a>.)</p>

<p class="section"><i>Activity of Charybdea.</i>&mdash;In speaking of the activity of Charybdea,
I cannot do better than refer the reader to the notes. (Experiment
<a href="#exp41">41</a>.) Conant remarks in his dissertation what an active swimmer
Charybdea is, and this is further borne out by his later observations.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Temperature.</i>&mdash;Ice in the water seemed to have no effect, except
when held against an animal, when a slowing of pulsation followed
in a few instances. On some pulsating actively in the sun the
temperature of the water was found to be 92° F. (Experiments <a href="#exp33">33-35</a>.)</p>

<p>Conant does not tell us how cold the water became when he
placed ice in it, but judging from his results, it seems that he might
have obtained a decided slowing of pulsation if the water in which
the medusæ swam had been permitted to approach anywhere near
the freezing point, say 35-40° F. Romanes obtained decided slowing
of pulsation, and even complete inhibition, on a bell of Aurelia, as
also a lengthening of the latent period on some strips cut from a
bell of Aurelia, by lowering the temperature of the water. Replacing
Aurelia in warmer water had the effect of immediate recovery and
increased rhythm. In Aurelia, raising the temperature increased the
rhythm but diminished it when the temperature of the water became
70-80° F. After a slowing of pulsation due to such a rise of temperature,
it would not quicken again when the animal was placed in
water of its normal temperature. Romanes explains this by supposing
that the tissue of the medusa had been permanently injured by the
abnormally high temperature. It would be interesting to observe
how the tropical Aurelia behaved under such treatment, seeing that
Charybdea pulsated actively and without apparent injury in water at
92° F. <i>Limnocodium</i>, noted by Romanes, and probably a tropical
species, lived happily in water at 85° F. in the lily house of the Royal
Botanical Society. The temperature of the water could be raised to
100° F. before it proved fatal to this medusa. Such facts point to a
decided difference in the constitution of the protoplasm of tropical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
temperate medusæ. Romanes’ Sarsia became frantic when placed in
milk-warm water.</p>

<p>While writing the above, I was led to wonder whether the
temperature of the water may not have been the stimulating
influence in those experiments on light (previously noted) in which
the medusæ continued to swim actively in the sunlight.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Food and Feeding.</i>&mdash;See Experiment <a href="#exp36">36</a>.</p>

<p>I again make note of a few observations made by myself on
the Olindiad. A crustacean became entangled in the tentacles of a
medusa; apparently this wished to retain it, for the proboscis reached
in the direction of the crustacean, which, however, got away. I then
placed, by means of a needle, another small crustacean against one of
the tentacles. This was seized but not retained, for the animal
pulsated and it was washed away by the water. Twice I saw a good-sized
crustacean in the proboscis. In one instance the velum appeared
to hold the part of the crustacean not yet in the proboscis. I noticed
another with a crustacean wholly in the proboscis, which was much
lengthened out, the upper part of the crustacean being in the stomach.
The next morning the crustacean was wholly in the stomach and the
proboscis normal. At 5.30 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span> the crustacean was ejected, nothing
but the shell and some rubbish remaining.</p>

<p>These medusæ seem to pay no attention to being touched by one
of their kind, except to give a pulsation or two.</p>

<p>The proboscis appears very “intelligent” in its actions.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> First,
some of the tentacles can be seen to contract and to bend inwards,
then the side next the tentacles contracts and the proboscis is seen
to reach in that direction. I could not see, however, what the irritant
was.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Occurrence of Charybdea</i>&mdash;Experiments <a href="#exp37">37-40</a>.&mdash;Dr. Conant’s remarks
(“Cubomedusæ”) on the occurrence of Charybdea at the surface of
quite shallow water and near the shore (which is quite at variance
with former observations, that the Cubomedusæ are essentially deep-sea
forms) are further borne out by his observations at Port Antonio.
As already noted in the Introduction, Charybdea was here found in
abundance in quite shallow water and near shore, but on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bottom instead of at the surface as at Port Henderson. It is possible
that the animals had been active near the surface earlier in the
morning and that some unknown conditions determined their settling
to the bottom earlier in the former place than in the latter.</p>

<p>Conant’s conjecture, “whether these were their natural conditions,
or whether the two forms,” Charybdea and Tripedalia, “were driven
by some chance from the deep ocean into the harbor and there
found their surroundings secondarily congenial, so to speak,”
seems to be borne out in favor of the former supposition (for
Charybdea at least),&mdash;that these are their natural conditions and that
Charybdea Xaymacana is essentially a shore form.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Aurelia and Polyclonia</span> (<span class="smcap">Cassiopœa</span>)</h3>

<p class="center">Experiments <a href="#exp42">42-53</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the observations on these forms relate to the rate of
pulsation. In an Aurelia, following the removal of a lithocyst, there
was a pause followed by pulsations. In about two minutes rhythmic
pulsations were renewed. Four minutes after the operation there
were nineteen pulsations to the half minute, while twenty minutes
after there were only nine, and these in groups of six and three.
The normal rate of pulsation was twenty-five to the half minute.</p>

<p>Polyclonia behaved much in the same manner as Aurelia. Upon
the removal of lithocyst pulsations continued, but in groups with
short pauses. The normal rate of pulsation was twenty-seven to the
half minute, while three minutes after the operation it was
seventeen, and eleven minutes after, fifteen to the half minute.
The tissue connected with a removed lithocyst gave contractions.
Placing a Polyclonia in fresh sea-water more than doubled the
rate of pulsation, which, however, soon fell to the normal rate, and
lower in one instance. In small individuals the rhythm is decidedly
more rapid than in those of larger size. The few observations on
this point would seem to show that it is in inverse proportion to the
squares of the diameters of the bells.</p>

<p>The removal of a single oral arm or of the whole eight, in
Polyclonia, had much the same effect as the removal of a lithocyst:
there was a decided slowing of the rate of pulsation, while the
immediate effect of cutting was an acceleration or a return to near
the normal rate. About a day later this same animal had quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
regained its normal rate of pulsation and continued to live over two
weeks. A long latent period followed the cutting of an arm, before
the stimulation of cutting manifested itself.</p>

<p>An Aurelia, with all its lithocysts removed, still gave spontaneous
and coördinated contractions after allowing time for recovery from
the operation. This was the result in one instance, while in several
others only a few contractions were observed. Removal of the
sixteen marginal bodies (lithocysts) in a Cassiopœa produced paralysis
for a time but recovery soon followed. A Polyclonia with its entire
margin removed was paralyzed but had so far recovered in a day
as to be able, at intervals, to give spontaneous pulsations.</p>

<p>The removed margin of a Polyclonia pulsated vigorously. This
margin was then split so as to make a ring within a ring but
connected at one point by a small bridge of tissue. The waves of
contraction, which always originated on the ring with the lithocysts,
passed the bridge to the inner ring quite as Romanes experienced.
The outer ring was next split so as to separate the exumbral
portion from the subumbral, when it was found that the contractions
always originated from the latter. Seven days after its removal,
this same margin was still alive and pulsating vigorously, and
broken-off pieces of the subumbral portion were pulsating by
themselves. Fifteen of the ganglia were removed. It was then
found that while most of the pulsations originated at the remaining
ganglion, now and then contractions originated in other parts where
no ganglion remained. Two days later this margin was still alive
with contractions originating as often from other parts as from the
ganglion. A similar observation was made on a margin of Cassiopœa.</p>

<p>A Polyclonia with the eight lithocysts of one side removed, to
compare with a normal one, gave no evidence of affected coördination.</p>

<p>An oral lobe from an Aurelia could give contractions some
minutes after removal.</p>

<p>In another Aurelia a circular cut was made about the base of
the oral lobes through the epithelium of the subumbrella. The
animal could pulsate well enough but coördination seemed a little
affected, while in another one with a like cut but semicircular, no
effect was noticed.</p>

<p>These results on the removal of the lithocysts (and margin in
Polyclonia) in Aurelia, Polyclonia and Cassiopœa agree quite with
those on Charybdea and, of course, also with Romanes’ and Eimer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
results as to paralysis and recovery following the removal of the
lithocysts, or margin, in Aurelia, Cyanea, etc. I recall no similar
observations, however, on removing a single lithocyst, and the
question of an explanation for the slowing of the rhythm thus
brought about arises. Romanes gives as an explanation for the
slowing of the rhythm (Aurelia, Cyanea, etc.) following the temporary
acceleration upon removing the manubrium or a portion
from the center of the bell, as due to a lack of an afferent stimulating
influence upon the ganglia from the excised tissue. May a similar
explanation not serve to explain the slowing following the removal
of a single lithocyst, above noted? The removed lithocyst could no
longer give its efferent stimulus to the remaining ganglia nor to
the tissue, so that the former would have a weaker stimulating
influence, in consequence of which the latter (the contractile tissue)
would be deprived of a part of the original stimulus of the
remaining ganglia as also of that of the removed ganglion. The
whole would thus result in giving to the contractile tissue a weaker
stimulus, which, again, would require longer and greater recovery on
the part of the tissue in order to be set off by the stimulus at
hand. This explanation is given on the basis of Romanes’ theory
of rhythmic contraction previously explained.</p>

<p>Of course, it may be suggested that the musculature had lost
tonus, due to the lack of influence of the removed ganglion (lithocyst),
in consequence of which there was a lowering of irritability on the
part of the contractile tissue. This would require a greater summation
of stimulating influence (Ganglionic theory of contraction)
on the part of the remaining ganglia to set it off. Again, the loss of
irritability on the part of the contractile tissue may have been due
to a lack of nutritive influence from the removed ganglion.</p>

<p>Romanes’ explanation, that the slowing of the rhythm following
the removal of the manubrium and central parts of the bell in
Aurelia and Cyanea is due to a lack of an afferent stimulus on the
ganglia from the removed tissue, likewise explains the similar results
obtained by Conant by removing the oral arms from Polyclonia.</p>

<p>The fact that a margin of Cassiopœa and also of Polyclonia,
connected with but one ganglion, often originated contractions in
other parts as well as from the ganglion, seems to show that
motor centers resided in the margin outside of the ganglia. This
would be somewhat at variance with Romanes’ conclusion, that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
such centers existed in the Scyphomedusæ. Conant does not state
whether the Polyclonia margin in question was kept in fresh sea-water
or whether the water was not changed during the seven days.
If the latter is the case, then some poisonous compounds may have
been formed that acted as a stimulus much as weakly acidulated
water served Romanes in producing rhythmic contractions in
deganglionated bells.</p>

<p>Again, while it is true that no ganglia are known to exist in the
margins of the Scyphomedusæ outside of the ganglia in the marginal
bodies, yet, ganglion cells and nerve fibers are found in the subumbral
part of the margin as well as in the rest of the umbrella.
And as I know no reason why scattered ganglion cells may not
function as ganglia, it is possible that the contractions in question
were spontaneous.</p>

<p>Finally, is it possible that the remaining ganglion originated
the contractions in different parts of the margin, thus acting
at a distance from the points at which contractions originated?
Romanes gives an instance in which he believed to have evidence
that this was the case. Upon a final consideration I am inclined
to this latter explanation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Summary.</span></h3>

<p>Summing up for Charybdea, we have seen that it is very sensitive to
light, strong light as also darkness inhibiting pulsations, while
moderate light stimulates it to activity. Also, a sudden change from
weaker to stronger light, or <i>vice versa</i>, may inhibit or stimulate to
activity respectively. This behavior of Charybdea seems to be
correlated with its habit of life on the bottom. We have no
reason to doubt but that the eyes of the sensory clubs are the seat
of light sensation.</p>

<p>The experiments on equilibration are negative, giving us no
certain light on the function of the concretions, though it appears
that they may serve, in part at least, for keeping the sensory clubs
properly suspended. Their function in giving the animal sensations
of space relations is not, however, excluded.</p>

<p>Excision of the sensory clubs demonstrates that they are the seat
of important ganglionic centers, the removal of which results in
temporary paralysis and weakness. That they also are the seat of
organs (eyes, network-cells, concretions) that are of importance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
giving information in the life of Charybdea, is evident from the
reaching motion of the proboscis after the removal of the sensory
clubs. Other centers of spontaneity in their order of importance
probably are: the radial ganglia (one experiment); the interradial
ganglia (?); the suspensoria, as shown by their supplying stimuli to
isolated pieces of the sides connected with them; the frenula and the
velarium, the latter of which gave contractions when removed with
the frenula or in pieces only. No evidence is given that the frenula or
the velarium can impart their contractions to other tissue, though this
seems probable for the former. The proboscis can also contract of itself.</p>

<p>Reflexes between the velarium, frenula, subumbrella, sensory clubs,
nerve, and any one pedalium, on the one hand, and the pedalia on
the other hand, are very common, and point to the pedalia with the
tentacles as organs of defense and offense. The pedalia serve also as
rudders in swimming.</p>

<p>Finally, as judged by the results in this paper, Charybdea seems
to occupy, physiologically, a position intermediate between the
Hydromedusæ and the Scyphomedusæ. In its great activity as a
swimmer, in its response to light, and in its reflexes it is Hydromedusan,
while in the paralysis and recovery following the removal of
its marginal bodies, as also in its response with several pulsations
instead of one, when a deganglionated bell is stimulated, it is Scyphomedusan.</p>

<p>The observations on the Discomedusæ, Aurelia, Polyclonia, Cassiopœa,
demonstrate the existence of motor nerve centers in the
marginal bodies; but that other centers are present is shown by the
recovery of pulsation following the removal of the marginal bodies
or the margin. These results are mainly confirmatory of those of
Romanes and Eimer. They differ from these in the fact that margins
of Polyclonia and Cassiopœa, with only one ganglion attached,
originated contractions distant from the ganglion. Removing of a
single lithocyst resulted in a slowing of pulsation, as did also the
removal of the oral lobes, though the immediate effect in the latter
case was an acceleration. Isolated pieces of the subumbrella could
contract.</p>

<h2 id="DR_CONANTS_NOTES">DR. CONANT’S NOTES.</h2>

<p>Below follow Dr. Conant’s notes. They are printed about as
Conant left them. Their order of succession, however, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
changed to bring similar experiments together, while useless and
often repeated ones have been omitted, and short elliptical sentences
completed. Where the present writer wished to add any explanation,
the same has been placed in brackets.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Charybdea.</span></h3>

<p class="section" id="exp1"><i>Light and Darkness.</i>&mdash;1. Eight medusæ, in a deep glass jar and
covered by a black coat, except one inch around the top, were
placed in the dark-room.</p>

<p>a. When light from a lamp was thrown on the surface (one
inch) layer, the animals were active near the surface; when the
light was withdrawn, one or two were on the bottom and not moving
but were probably pulsating.</p>

<p>b. After four or five minutes in the dark, three or four besides a
feeble one are on the bottom. It took about two minutes to get them
all to swim [by the lamp]. Of the three on the bottom, one, at any
rate, was not pulsating. [Three other attempts like a and b were
made, with very similar results.]</p>

<p id="exp2">2. Experiment No. <a href="#exp1">1</a> was repeated several weeks later. Four in
a large round glass dish were placed in the dark-room. A lamp
being held to the dish all but one were found to be on the bottom.
That one quickly went to the bottom, while two of those on the
bottom quickly came to the top. In two or three minutes the one
that had gone to the bottom began to pulsate and at about the
same time the other one that had remained on the bottom also
began to pulsate, while the two that had gone to the top stayed
there swimming very actively. [Repeated with like results.]</p>

<p id="exp3">3. Fresh ones did not show the reaction to light after darkness
so well as did those in the experiments previously recorded. They
were experimented with about nine <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span>, while usually they were
tried later in the day. I had rather suspected from previous work
that they would not react so well when fresh.</p>

<p id="exp4">4. a. In walking with the jar (1) of jelly-fish of experiment <a href="#exp1">1</a>
from the dark-room to the back porch of the laboratory (fifty steps),
in the bright sun and a cool breeze, all were found upon entering
the laboratory door to have settled to the bottom and most of them
to have ceased active swimming. In five minutes two or three were
swimming somewhat, and in five minutes more all but one or two
(eight in all) were swimming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking with the jar about the laboratory did not suffice to
make any change in their swimming, nor did blowing on the surface
make any appreciable change.</p>

<p>b. Upon taking the jar to the back porch and placing it on the
stone or cement flags, in the shade and a cool breeze, in four
minutes time all were on the bottom not even pulsating.</p>

<p>Upon replacing them on the laboratory table all began to swim
about at once. [Repeated.]</p>

<p>c. The jar (1) was placed on the back porch again; in fifteen
seconds three were on the bottom; in one-half minute all but one.
In three or four minutes all were on the bottom, but two were
swimming lively and the others pulsating. In another minute all
were swimming.</p>

<p>d. The jar (1) was tried again, not resting it on the flags but
holding it by my hands on the sides. The effect was just as quick;
they stopped pulsating at once. By the time I had got back to my
table in the laboratory, one was at the surface and another arrived
just as the jar was set down.</p>

<p>[Several other experiments of an order similar to those just noted
were tried, with very similar results.]</p>

<p id="exp5">5. Two buckets stood side by side in the laboratory. One bucket
(1) had more Charybdeas in it than the other bucket (2), and also
had more since brought in (about an hour). The water of one (1)
was also more discolored and with more organic matter (sea weed,
etc.). In the laboratory the animals were active on the surface of
both buckets. Placed in the sunlight on the porch, no breeze, the
sun slanting so that one side of the water in the buckets was
bright while the other side was shaded, the jelly-fish in (1) went
mostly to the bottom, while those in (2) seemed unaffected though
some showed a tendency to go to the bottom after a longer
exposure. The experiment with (1) was repeated and it took some
five minutes for them all to go to the bottom. In a few minutes
after replacing them in the laboratory several were active again on
the surface.</p>

<p id="exp6">6. Jar (a) with five large ones stood on my table; they were quite
active. Placed in the sun (no breeze), on the porch, one or two sank
to the bottom at once and the others seemed to slow their activities
somewhat but not very markedly. In a few minutes all were swimming,
apparently more actively than before, in the bright sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>[In other experiments Conant shows that it is not the stimulus
of walking that causes them to swim when carried into the room,
for they would not swim when he walked with them on the porch.
Also, he shows how they may change, some swimming, others not,
when left for some time in any one place.]</p>

<p id="exp7">7. In a tumbler were two pulsating very vigorously. Placed in
the bright sunlight, very little breeze now and then, they showed no
change whatever.</p>

<p id="exp8">8. Some in a jar were covered with a black coat. The coat was
taken off, and almost immediately they stopped pulsating, or pulsated
but feebly, and sank to the bottom. The coat was put on again with
one part near the bottom of the jar exposed. Almost at once, the
animals, which were quite motionless, pulsating but little, resumed
pulsation, which became more and more vigorous, and quickly swam
to the top again. It seems plainly to be a reaction to light. [Such
experiments as this were repeated at different times with very like
results.]</p>

<p id="exp9">9. A bucket with several bobbing actively on the surface was set
out in a smart shower, and the animals continued bobbing on the
surface as before. I could not see that they made the slightest
attempt to go below.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that there is an individual difference
in sensitiveness to the reaction of light after darkness. E. g., I just
removed the coat from a dish with four in it; one went to the bottom
at once, another presently, a third remained active at the surface,
the fourth when noticed was on the bottom.</p>

<p>There is also a difference in the length of time they stay on the
bottom as well as in the quickness in the response to light. Some
recover very quickly, should say in less than a minute, and at once
become very active. Some stay for a long time and only resume
activity upon the coat being placed over them. Perhaps this explains
some of the observations in Experiment <a href="#exp1">1</a>.</p>

<p class="section" id="exp10"><i>Sensory Clubs.</i>&mdash;10. All four concretions were removed and the
animal stood the operation well. It swam more restlessly, however,
than others did in the same surroundings. It seemed at first to show
a trace of loss of sense-perception. It swam up, and down again,
more changeable than those intact, which stay rather more constantly
either on the bottom or at the surface. This may, however, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
due solely to the restlessness of the animal after the operation. Later
it swam actively for by far the most part on the surface only, which
points to the truth of the preceding statement.</p>

<p>It showed no reaction to <em>light</em>. A coat placed over the jar was
removed, when it was found to be on the surface and it remained
there. This was twice repeated. I noticed specially that on pushing
the bell above the surface of the water it at once turned and went
deeper as the normal animal does. Finally, given another a trial with
removing the coat from the jar, it went to the bottom as the normal
animal usually does. After this, when next seen, it was keeping to
the bottom. [This experiment was repeated on another occasion with
almost identical results, no loss of sense-perception being noticeable.]</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed as if access of <em>light</em> at removing the coat
acted as a stimulus to one or more of those that were quiescent on
the bottom. This was noticed again on the following day.</p>

<p id="exp11">11. Two more were operated upon. These did not stand the
operation well and stayed on the bottom, one swimming, while eight
hours later one was in better condition (pulsating) than two left in
the same dish for comparison.</p>

<p id="exp12">12. a. Three clubs were cut off leaving only the stalks. A
temporary paralysis of the power to swim was the immediate effect.
Later it partially recovered this power. The proboscis, which was
previously quiet, now showed convulsive twitchings and movements.
It continued for some time to move to one side and then the other
(after short pauses of varied length) as if to grasp some object.
The lips of the <em>proboscis</em> were also moving and at times expanding.
Often the movements were towards the side on which the club was
uninjured.</p>

<p>b. The fourth club was next removed. A temporary paralysis
as before resulted, followed by a quick recovery of pulsation; but
the animal was now much weakened. The movement of the
proboscis continued&mdash;shortening, lips expanding, moving to this side
or that. The pulsations of the bell were kept up even when too
weak to swim.</p>

<p>c. The sensory niches of this same animal were treated with 2.5
per cent. acetic acid by means of a pipette. The stalks of all four
clubs showed white. Pulsations ceased. The velarium showed feeble
local contractions. The movements of the proboscis and suspensoria
drawing down the stomach continued. Upon stirring the animal it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
gave rather feeble, somewhat convulsive pulsations with local
(fibrillar) contractions; the pulsations in some cases were pretty well
coördinated, but were more on the twitching kind.</p>

<p id="exp13">13. Three clubs were removed. The animal pulsated well, only
a little less strongly, perhaps. After a minute or two the fourth
club was removed. It pulsated almost immediately, perhaps thirty
seconds after the operation. It swam very well and pulsated feebly
five hours after the operation.</p>

<p id="exp14">14. One from jar (a) (Experiment <a href="#exp6">6</a>) was operated upon.
When the first club was cut off there was a paralysis of pulsation
followed by a quick recovery. Cutting off the second club seemed
to stimulate pulsation, the third to diminish it; after cutting off
the fourth club it still pulsated. When placed in a large jar it
pulsated on the bottom, but not strong enough to swim. The
pulsations were fairly regular and sometimes seemed to occur in
groups of two, but these groups were not well marked.</p>

<p id="exp15">15. Another one from jar (a) was taken. One club was cut out,
upon which there was a very temporary paralysis followed by good
pulsations afterwards. The <em>proboscis</em>, as in all cases noticed, gave
active movements to this side and that side. These movements of
the proboscis were often very quick and definitely directed as if a
well defined stimulus were given. After the operation one <em>pedalium</em>
contracted so as to be at a right angle to the main axis of the bell;
shortly a second pedalium also contracted. Placed in a small round
dish the animal swam actively.</p>

<p>A second club was removed, and it swam as well as before. After
fifteen minutes it was not swimming but pulsating against the jar.
Upon stirring it a little it swam vigorously ten to fifteen strokes
and then stopped. It seemed weak and its movements appeared
not so definite, though this might be due to weakness.</p>

<p>A third club was removed. The only change seemed to be
rather greater weakness.</p>

<p>After about five minutes the fourth club was removed. Paralysis
of pulsation followed. It had the power to contract its <em>pedalia</em>
when these were rather vigorously stimulated with a needle. It
also gave one feeble pulsation when so stimulated.</p>

<p id="exp16">16. The sensory clubs were removed from another. After removal
of the third one it still pulsated actively, but stopped completely and
apparently for good after the removal of the fourth club. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
one stopped pulsating apparently for good upon removing the third
club.</p>

<p id="exp17">17. All four sensory clubs were removed from one, cutting as
high up as possible so as to remove the endodermal tract of nerve
fibers of the peduncle. It pulsated afterwards apparently the same
as if the stalks had been left intact.</p>

<p id="exp18">18. A small piece surrounding a sensory club and including the
<em>margin</em> can contract by itself. The piece observed pulsated with
quick pulsations and rhythmically but intermittently. After a fresh
cutting away of such a piece, the portion of the <em>velarium</em> attached
was seen to contract rhythmically, while the rest of the <em>subumbrella</em>
was not so seen. The part of the subumbrella above the radial
ganglion that was cut off did not contract by itself. The same
portion of the velarium cut off did give contractions.</p>

<p id="exp19">19. A sensory club with the surrounding region cut out pulsated
rhythmically; when the club was cut from the end of its stalk
pulsation stopped. This observation was repeated on another, and
contractions were seen after the removal of the club. A piece of
the <em>subumbrella</em> wall from the same animal gave contractions now
and then even after an hour.</p>

<p id="exp20">20. The normal position of a sensory club seems to be with
the concretion almost at the lowermost end; often with it certainly
lowermost, but probably oftener with the perpendicular passing
through the center of the attachment of the club to its peduncle
and just by the inner edge of the concretion. The eyes point inwards.</p>

<p>When the animal is on its side the concretions are always quite
lowermost. When the animal was inverted the tendency was for
the concretions to be lowermost. In this position the eyes may
point in several directions. In one instance those of one club pointed
rather outwards, while of two other clubs they pointed more in the
plane of the body wall. (See also Experiments <a href="#exp24">24</a>, <a href="#exp29">29</a>.)</p>

<p class="section" id="exp21"><i>Nerve.</i>&mdash;21. Cutting the nerve eight times, once on each side of
each sensory club, produced no loss of coördination in pulsating.
The animal was weakened, however, by the operation, which was made
drastic to insure cutting the nerve; but it was still able to swim.
This experiment was repeated four times.</p>

<p id="exp22">22. That coördination was continued after the nerve was cut
was proved beyond doubt by cutting from the edge up (eight times)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
so as to perfectly separate the sensory clubs and the pedalia.
Pulsations continued synchronously in all four sides&mdash;not the
slightest evidence that one side contracted out of time with the
others.</p>

<p id="exp23">23. The eight cuts were made as in the preceding experiment
with no loss of coördination noted. When the cuts were carried up
to the base of the stomach, however, coördination ceased. The four
side pieces seemed to contract each in its own time. Only two sides
could be observed at one time, and they at any rate did not contract
synchronously. One side often gave two contractions while the
other side rested or gave one.</p>

<p>Yet, a little later, three of the sides at any rate showed a
pretty good coördination. The fourth was smaller and did not seem
to get into the game much&mdash;it went more on its own schedule.
The four pieces were then cut apart and placed together under a
dissecting microscope. No coördination at all could be made out.
No evidence, therefore, of any definite rate of pulsation inherent in
the sensory clubs.</p>

<p>Cutting the nerve causes the <em>pedalia</em> to forcibly contract inwards.</p>

<p class="section" id="exp24"><i>Side, Subumbrella.</i>&mdash;24. A whole side was cut out, the transverse
cut being above the sensory organ so as to take off [leave off] the
radial ganglion also. This pulsated, or rather contracted, nicely.
The upper end had been cut just through the <em>suspensorium</em>. It
especially gave twitchings like the twitchings of the stomach. The
piece was then halved transversely, when the upper part containing
the portion of the suspensorium twitched as before while the lower
part was not seen to contract again. This was repeated with the same
result, except that a portion of the lower part gave a slight contraction
several times. The part that contracted was at the upper end of the
piece, <i>i. e.</i>, nearest the <em>suspensorium</em>. The contractions were also more
longitudinal than transverse, as the regular contractions would be.</p>

<p>The piece connected with the sensory clubs of course pulsated
nicely. Upon cutting off the sensory club from the stalk, pulsation
ceased, but twitching of the <em>velarium</em> continued. This was repeated
with the same effect.</p>

<p>In the same animal, in cutting off the sides, the stomach was
left, the cut being through the gastric ostium. The floor of the
<em>stomach</em> was now cut off by cutting out the four interradial points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
attachment. The stomach and the proboscis gave vigorous contractions
and tied themselves all up so that I could not cut off the
proboscis.</p>

<p>The four pieces of the floor of the stomach left on the interradii
gave contractions nicely. The phacelli continued their squirming
movements.</p>

<p id="exp25">25. Cutting off the whole aboral end of the animal excites to
very rapid pulsations of the remaining part. The stream, as shown
by particles in the water, is apparently stronger out the aboral end
than past the velarium.</p>

<p>It seems that I get no good evidence that the subumbrella is able
to contract of itself without connection with special nerve centers.
In the one case noted (Experiment <a href="#exp31">31</a>) I could not be sure but that
the part that contracted was intimately associated with the suspensorium
or frenulum.</p>

<p id="exp26">26. A piece of the subumbrella cut off and having, so far as I
could determine, no connection with ganglia, frenula, or suspensoria,
gave contractions. Another piece was not seen to contract.</p>

<p>A small piece of the subumbrella connected with a club can contract.
The proboscis can give contractions of itself when cut off with the
base of the stomach. Even a cut-off lip can twitch by itself. A
portion of the subumbrella by itself also showed twitchings. (See also
Experiments <a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp19">19</a>, <a href="#exp25">25</a>, <a href="#exp26">26</a>, <a href="#exp29">29</a>, <a href="#exp47">47</a>, <a href="#exp49">49</a>.)</p>

<p class="section" id="exp27"><i>Pedalia, Velarium, Radial and Interradial Ganglia.</i>&mdash;27. The pedalia
with their tentacles were cut off at their bases to insure cutting out
the interradial ganglia. The animal could pulsate well enough, but
intermittently and without much progress (the velarium, of course,
being injured). Cutting one pedalium caused the others to contract.</p>

<p id="exp28">28. When the pedalia were cut off from one, the power of direct
motion was entirely gone. It swam in circles, turned summersaults,
changed its course continually, the oral end getting ahead of the aboral
end, or trying to do so. The whole power of balancing was gone. It
seemed excited by the operation and swam continually. [Repeated.]</p>

<p id="exp29">29. The pedalia can be made to contract inwards by stroking their
outer edge with a needle. This was noted last year and has been
seen several times this year. Their inner edge is not so sensitive.</p>

<p>Touching a <em>sensory club</em> caused the pedalia to contract inwards in
two cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The pedalia could be made to contract by giving the subumbrella
a prick,&mdash;generally a rather severe one was necessary. The upper
part of the subumbrella seems not so sensitive as the lower part and
the proboscis, and the base of the stomach did not give any reflex
at all (two specimens). One of the two could be made to give the
reflex only with much difficulty. This was a very lively one. It
would even stand severe pricks on the nerve, or even through the
region of the sensory clubs, without contracting the pedalia or stopping
pulsations.</p>

<p>Cutting the frenula seemed not to affect the ability to swim well.
Cutting in this region brings about the reflex of the pedalia.</p>

<p>In the preceding fish the <em>velarium</em> was cut away wholly in some
places, in other places it was left only as ragged strips. The pedalia
became very strongly contracted and the <em>tentacles</em> were brought inside
the bell. Pulsations that seemed strong produced much less progress
than with the velarium intact. [Repeated.]</p>

<p id="exp30">30. One with the whole <em>margin</em> cut off still gave pulsations. Upon
the removal of the region of the <em>radial ganglia</em>, however, pulsations
were seen no more.</p>

<p>The <em>velarium</em> in the above continued to give twitchings. The four
pedalia were cut off with plenty of the tissue at their bases to insure
the removal of <em>interradial ganglia</em>, and twitchings of the velarium with
irregular contractions continued. No full contraction all around the
velarium was noticed. When all the tissue was trimmed off as nearly
as possible down to the <em>velarium</em>, the latter still gave twitchings and
irregular contractions as before,&mdash;even more so as if excited by the
operation. The power of originating contractions evidently resides in
the velarium or in the ganglion cells of the frenula just as it does in
the proboscis and the floor of the stomach.</p>

<p>Small pieces cut from between the pedalium corners and the
frenula, so as to have tissue on them from neither, could contract
by themselves. (See also for Pedalia, Experiments <a href="#exp15">15</a>, <a href="#exp23">23</a>, <a href="#exp41">41b</a>;
Velarium <a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp41">41c</a>.)</p>

<p class="section" id="exp31"><i>Tentacles.</i>&mdash;31. A cut-off tentacle can contract by itself, sometimes
with squirming contractions. A prick at either end can produce a
forcible contraction. A slight prick at the distal end may produce a
local contraction. The proximal end is more sensitive, but this difference
is not very marked. One with only the tentacles removed
seemed to be a little less able to guide itself well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p class="section" id="exp32"><i>Proboscis, Stomach, Phacelli.</i>&mdash;32. The lips of the proboscis are
highly contractile by themselves. The movement of the stomach and
the phacelli goes on, after the lips are cut off, with increased vigor,
due to the stimulus of shock. The vigor and frequency of their
contractions, however, diminish quicker than that of the cut-off lips.
(See for Proboscis, <a href="#exp12">12</a>, <a href="#exp15">15</a>, <a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp26">26</a>, <a href="#exp29">29</a>; Stomach, <a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp24">24</a>, <a href="#exp29">29</a>, <a href="#exp31">31</a>; Phacelli,
<a href="#exp18">18</a>, <a href="#exp24">24</a>, <a href="#exp31">31</a>.)</p>

<p class="section" id="exp33"><i>Temperature.</i>&mdash;33. Temperature does not seem to have much effect.
Some placed in a tumbler half full of water, in the bright sunlight,
swam vigorously over three-fourths of an hour. The water was quite
warm to the hand.</p>

<p id="exp34">34. The above experiment was repeated with the same results.
A thermometer placed in the water with them showed 92° F.; hung
in the sun near by, it showed 94° F.</p>

<p>Ice in the water did not stop their pulsating temporarily or
permanently, except that it did for a short time after being held
against one. Even then it took some time (fifteen to twenty
pulsations) before it produced any effect.</p>

<p id="exp35">35. Ice placed in the water again showed no marked effect. They
swam as lively as ever. Some, after pulsating against the ice for a
little while, seemed to be less vigorous, but quickly recovered in
another part of the jar. Others did not seem to be the least bit
affected by contact with the ice.</p>

<p class="section" id="exp36"><i>Food and Feeding.</i>&mdash;36. I tried to feed one. A red and a white
copepod were put into the subumbrella cavity. No attempt to eat it
was observed in either case, though the copepods remained in the
subumbrella cavity for some time.</p>

<p>Animals found in the stomach of Charybdea: small fish were
most frequently seen; at another time a small stomatopod; again, a
small polychæte; small shrimps; amphipod.</p>

<p>Those taken on August 16th (3 to 4 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>) seemed to have, for the
most part, food in the stomach, and this more so than those taken in
the morning.</p>

<p class="section" id="exp37"><i>Occurrence of Charybdea.</i>&mdash;37. In the first tow on the bottom
(with a net made of mosquito-netting and weighted with rocks in
order to sink it) the haul was forty. I do not think that we could
have been towing more than four or five minutes. The time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
about seven <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span> A light breeze was blowing and there had been a
heavy shower a half-hour previous.</p>

<p id="exp38">38. The usual time of towing was about 6.30 to 7.30 <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span> The
water was four to five feet (1.2 to 1.5 m.) nearest shore but deeper
farther out. At this time of day one could count on getting plenty
of the larger sized (15 to 20 mm.), many small ones, but very few of the
smallest. This was the experience of several mornings.</p>

<p>On August 12th I towed about nine <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span>, and got but few of the
larger sized, many small ones, and very many of the smallest.</p>

<p>The next day (7.00 to 7.45 <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span>) those obtained were mostly of
the larger size. On the same day (3 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>) others of the party towed
at the same place and obtained but few.</p>

<p>On another day I towed in the afternoon (3 to 4 <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span>) and
obtained great numbers as I usually did in the morning.</p>

<p id="exp39">39. We towed about 7.30 to 8.30 at night. Very few Charybdeæ were
taken. On this evening we towed five times in the same locality,
and obtained but seven or eight specimens. Towing with the same
net on our way home, it was filled with Aureliæ and five or six
Charybdeæ. It seems as if Charybdea came to the surface at night.
Those towed in the evening were dead the next morning.</p>

<p>The next morning Richard, our colored attendant, towed from
5.30 to 6.30. There were heavy showers. The usual find of large and
medium ones was obtained. There were only two with planulae.</p>

<p id="exp40">40. The material of September 2nd was obtained about six <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span>
They were mostly of large size. In all only fifteen or twenty were
taken. Richard explained the small number by saying that the
bottom had changed in the locality where we usually towed and that
he got no weeds in his net, but mud.</p>

<p>The next day more were brought in by Richard (6.30 <span class="smcapuc">A. M.</span>)
There were rather more than yesterday but the quality was the same.
There were three with planulae.</p>

<p>On another morning Richard brought in a great many, about a
hundred. Among these there were three with planulae (light-colored
and budding); on a previous day there was one with the reddish-brown
kind and with a mouth.</p>

<p class="section" id="exp41"><i>Activity of Charybdea.</i>&mdash;41. a. About five o’clock in the morning a
Charybdea was taken in the tow. It was in good condition
swimming incessantly round and round without change of direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in a jar of about twenty centimeters in diameter. It came to the
surface every now and then, after eight to fifteen pulsations. The
tentacles and the phacelli were of a lilac shade. If a pencil was
placed in its way it would pulsate against it repeatedly without any
effort to dodge around it.</p>

<p>At 10.15 it went around the dish in eight seconds, taking eighteen
or nineteen pulsations. If a bright platinum spatula or a black
pencil was placed in its circuit it would repeatedly butt against
it each time it came around. After the second or third pulsation
against it, however, it seemed to have some sense to change its
direction.</p>

<p>b. The <em>pedalia</em> have no perceptible action of their own. They
move inwards slightly toward the axis at each pulsation, but
scarcely as much as one would suppose from their attachment to
the pulsating margin. It seems as if they were for “winging” the
moving animal more than for anything else.</p>

<p>c. The <em>velarium</em> is loose and it flaps. It seems to take part in
swimming something more than the passive diaphragm function,&mdash;i. e.,
it straightens out during the recovery after each contraction of
the bell.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Aurelia and Polyclonia.</span></h3>

<p>[The following experiments were performed at Port Henderson,
Jamaica, in 1896.]</p>

<p id="exp42">42. May 12th. An <i>Aurelia</i> was pulsating normally at the rate
of twenty-five or twenty-six pulsations to the half-minute. One
lithocyst was cut out, when a few contractions, evidently caused by
the stimulus of cutting, followed; then, rest. In the first minute
there were only about five pulsations. In two or three minutes
rhythmic pulsations were resumed. Four minutes after the cutting
there were nineteen pulsations to the half-minute. About twenty
minutes after there were nine to the half-minute, in groups of six
and three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A <i>Polyclonia</i>, about four and one-half inches (115 mm.) in diameter,
gave twenty-six or twenty-seven regular pulsations to the half-minute.
After one otocyst was removed, pulsations continued, but in
groups with intervals of pause: <i>e. g.</i>, thirteen, pause; ten, pause; six.
Three minutes after the removal of the lithocyst there were 5, 3, 1,
3, 5, or seventeen pulsations to the half-minute. Eleven minutes
after the operation there were fifteen to the half-minute. The
removed lithocyst and surrounding tissue gave contractions.</p>

<p id="exp43">43. May 13th. The <i>Aurelia</i> was in rather poor condition but
would pulsate upon being stirred. The other seven lithocysts were
removed when only a few contractions originated thereafter.</p>

<p>The <i>Polyclonia</i> was in good condition, but was pulsating only
intermittently when first seen in the morning. When the remaining
seven lithocysts were cut out and no more pulsations were observed,
the oral arms could still move.</p>

<p>May 14th. Both were found dead upon returning in the evening.</p>

<p id="exp44">44. May 15th. An Aurelia and a Polyclonia were taken in the
morning. The <i>Aurelia</i> was two and one-half to three inches (62.5-75
mm.) in diameter, with three tufts of phacelli, three oral arms and
seven lithocysts. The <i>Polyclonia</i> was normal and seven or eight
inches (175-200 mm.) in diameter.</p>

<p>In the <i>Aurelia</i> all the lithocysts were removed. Spontaneous and
coördinated contractions could still occur after time had been allowed
for the shock from the operation to pass away. The next day the
animal was still alive and pulsating, but ragged, and the next day
following was quite dead.</p>

<p>In the <i>Polyclonia</i> the normal rhythm was fourteen pulsations to
the minute. Some pulsations were apparently quicker than others
and the intervals were not the same. Thirteen, ten, and twelve
pulsations were also counted. After putting the animal into fresh
sea-water, it pulsated thirty-three to the minute. Six minutes later it
was still pulsating at the same rate, while in four minutes more
eleven pulsations, many of which were in groups of two, were noted.
In five minutes more it pulsated eleven times to the minute with
only one double pulsation. One <em>oral arm</em> was then cut off and the
rhythm counted about one minute afterward&mdash;fourteen pulsations,
then a pause of fifteen seconds, then two pulsations, in all sixteen to
the minute were counted. About ten minutes later there were eight
pulsations, two or three minutes later only three, while in two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
minutes more only three. There was a long latent period&mdash;two or
three seconds&mdash;before the stimulation of cutting off the arm made
itself evident in the rhythm.</p>

<p>A second oral lobe was removed. Then there followed twenty-four
pulsations, a pause of two seconds, and two pulsations, in all twenty-six
pulsations to a minute. The rate of pulsation soon fell to the
previously abnormal low rate.</p>

<p>Third lobe removed: 21 pulsations in first half minute and then
16, or 37 per minute.</p>

<p>Fourth lobe removed: 17 pulsations in first half-minute plus 13
gives 30 for the minute.</p>

<p>No difference in the coördination of the animal was shown as a
result of the removal of one-half the number of oral arms.</p>

<p>Fifth lobe removed: 17 pulsations plus 15 equals 32 to the minute.</p>

<p>Sixth lobe removed: 17 in first half-minute plus 4 in the second
half-minute gives 21 pulsations for the minute.</p>

<p>Seventh lobe removed: 17 plus 9, or 26 per minute.</p>

<p>In all these instances the rhythm in the second half of the first
minute was irregular and intermittent.</p>

<p>Seventeen and then seven pulsations were provoked after the
animal had become quiescent, or nearly so, by merely handling it.</p>

<p id="exp45">45. Eighth oral lobe was removed and pulsations stopped. The next
day the animal was in good condition. The pulsations counted in the
evening were 12, 14, 14, 11, per minute. The rhythm was not
regular; there was a tendency to groups of twos, threes, or more, but
no prolonged intervals of rest were observed. When placed into
fresh sea-water, the pulsations were fourteen to the half-minute or
twenty-six to the minute; seventeen to the half-minute, and thirty-three
to the minute were also counted. This specimen gave spontaneous
contractions during two weeks, after which it was thrown
out, the aboral end being eaten through and little or no regeneration
having taken place.</p>

<p id="exp46">46. Two more were operated upon: A. Its rhythm was 18, 14, 17.
Its entire margin was cut off. The separate pieces of the margin
pulsated, 6, 7, 4, 6, 7, 9. The animal seemed paralyzed by the
operation; it responded by a contraction now and then to stimulation
but gave no spontaneous pulsations. B. Its rhythm was 17,
15, 12, 12. All its <em>oral arms</em> were removed. Its rhythm was only
raised to seventeen and not perfect. In twenty-five minutes it had
fallen to eleven, in four hours to ten pulsations [per minute].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>May 22nd. A and B are living as also the pieces of the <em>margin</em>
of A; all are giving spontaneous pulsations now and then at comparatively
long intervals&mdash;even A, with its margin removed.</p>

<p>May 26th. Everything is still living. The one with the margin
cut (A) counted sixteen and nineteen pulsations per minute, though
this was not kept up all the time.</p>

<p>June 2nd. A and B and pieces are still living and contracting
spontaneously. It is now two weeks, and they were thrown out eaten
through at the aboral end with little or no regeneration.</p>

<p id="exp47">47. The margin was cut off another one (C) and it was then
paralyzed. The margin contracted vigorously by itself. The margin
was next split, but a connection of about one-half an inch wide was left
between the two rings. Over this bridge the contractions passed
from the outer and inner ring. The inner ring did not originate
any contractions. Both rings were then cut near their connecting
bridge of tissue and the larger ring with the marginal bodies was
split longitudinally so as to separate the exumbral from the subumbral
portion. It was found that the contractions started only from
the subumbral portion while the exumbral portion did not contract
at all.</p>

<p>June 5th. Five of the eight small pieces of C were not seen to
contract either to-day or yesterday. A slow rotary motion was
observed in some of the pieces suggesting ciliation, but no cilia or
currents pointing to ciliation were seen with a low power. C was
seen to pulsate spontaneously. Possibly it did yesterday but it was
not watched closely. A piece of the subumbral surface of C broken
off (not from the margin) was found to contract spontaneously.</p>

<p id="exp48">48. June 6th. In a fresh one (D) from Port Royal, the eight lithocysts
of one side were removed in order to compare its movements
with an intact one. Coördination was apparently unaffected.</p>

<p>June 9th. The margin of C is still pulsating vigorously. Parts
of the subumbrella broken loose from the strip pulsated by themselves
now and then. Fifteen lithocysts were removed, leaving only
one at the end of the strip. It was found that with this single
ganglion (lithocyst) left, and originating most of the contractions, now
and then a contraction would originate at another part of the strip
where there was no ganglion. Three days later contractions
originated as often from other parts as from the ganglion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cassiopœa.</span></h3>

<p>[The remaining experiments were all performed in 1897, at Port
Antonio.]</p>

<p id="exp49">49. Removal of the sixteen marginal bodies caused paralysis for
a time; then recovery followed.</p>

<p>Contraction was limited to the subumbrella.</p>

<p>A portion of the <em>subumbrella</em> not from the margin can contract
by itself as well as a portion of the margin with the marginal bodies
(lithocysts).</p>

<p>In the <em>margin</em> cut off as a strip with only one marginal body
attached at one end, contractions sometimes started from the opposite
end.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Aurelia.</span></h3>

<p id="exp50">50. Size, seventeen or eighteen millimeters. Pulsations, thirty-two.
Lithocysts, nine. The operation consisted in the removal of the
concretions with as little injury to the pigmented parts of the
marginal bodies as possible. One whole marginal body, however, was
removed in the operation. Soon after the operation the pulsations
were 28, 26, 20, 20, per minute.</p>

<p>Another one; size fifteen millimeters. Pulsations were forty per
minute. The operation consisted in the removal of the concretions
and pigmented parts of the marginal bodies with as little injury to
the adjoining parts as possible. After the operation it seemed as if
the intervals between the pulsations were irregular,&mdash;not a series at
regular intervals. An hour or so after the operation the pulsations
were very intermittent. During the afternoon it was not seen to
pulsate except when it was stirred up, when six or seven vigorous
pulsations followed. These, however, were rather aimless.</p>

<p id="exp51">51. One sensory club (marginal body) was cut out, including its
basal part also. In one or two other cases more or less injury was
done to adjoining parts also. Pulsations ceased upon the removal of
the last club, but upon placing it in an aquarium and allowing it to
come to rest for two or three minutes, pulsations were now and then
seen. In the evening, this one and another did not pulsate except
when stirred, when they pulsated with good progress.</p>

<p id="exp52">52. A circular cut, about two inches in diameter, was made
through the epithelium of the subumbrella around the base of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
oral lobes. The animal pulsated well enough, but the contractions
seemed not so simultaneous in all parts of the margin as normally.
After a few days it had partly regenerated but died. One of the oral
lobes cut off had some power of contraction, and this some time after
the operation. A similar cut, but semicircular, made no difference
between the contractions of the two halves.</p>

<p id="exp53">53. The whole region of the sensory clubs was cut out when the
animal was not seen to pulsate again, except in the evening, when
pulsations were observed. The oral lobes also moved.</p>

<h2 id="HISTOLOGICAL">HISTOLOGICAL.</h2>

<p class="section"><i>Method.</i>&mdash;The following results on the histology of the sensory
clubs, their eyes, and the tentacles, as already noted, were obtained
from some of Dr. Conant’s preserved material. These results relate
almost wholly to Charybdea, with only a few references to Tripedalia,
noted in their proper place.</p>

<p>A portion of this material was killed after keeping the animals
in the dark for some time, for the purpose of discovering any
changes in the pigment of the eyes. I believe that a retraction
of the pigment of the long pigment cells that project between the
prisms and pyramids of the vitreous body in the retina of the distal
complex eye is very evident in eyes killed in the dark. (But more
on this below.)</p>

<p>I obtained my best results from the material preserved in
saturated corrosive sublimate, to which had been added (5 to 10 per
cent.) acetic acid. This also was Conant’s experience in his previous
work on Charybdea and Tripedalia.</p>

<p>My best sections were obtained by embedding the sensory clubs
in celoidin, passing the little blocks of celoidin with the sensory
clubs into chloroform until perfectly transparent, and then into
paraffine. I then cut sections as we ordinarily cut paraffine sections,
mounted and stained them on the slide. My purpose in using this
method was to avoid the displacement of the vitreous bodies of the
eyes during embedding and cutting. This object was fully realized
and more besides. Since the sections cut by the celoidin-paraffine
method gave me so decidedly the best differentiation of the axial
fibers of the retinal cells, as also of the cilia, basal bodies, etc., I am
inclined to believe that the celoidin was in part responsible for this
differentiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of my series were cut 4 µ in thickness. All in all I cut
sixty-five clubs besides making some maceration preparations from
material preserved for that purpose. These sixty-five series represent
material from fourteen bottles. As a whole, my material was good,
but the material from one bottle was decidedly superior for showing
the axial fibers of the prisms and pyramids of the retinal cells.
This shows the advantage of plenty of material. It will be evident
that I had plenty of material.</p>

<p>I found iron-hæmatoxylin the most satisfactory stain. I stained
for a shorter or a longer time&mdash;one-half to several hours and longer&mdash;and
then washed out the sections until under a low power of magnification
they appeared quite unstained, the nuclei and a few other
parts only appearing darkly stained.</p>

<p>Depigmentation I practiced but little. I obtained many of my
series almost wholly unpigmented, especially those I cut last. Others,
of course, were very heavily pigmented. I am not certain but that
alcohol slowly dissolves out the pigment after a long period of
preservation. Slight variations in the technique of killing and preserving
may also, perhaps, determine the stability or solubility of the
pigment, as, of course, also the condition of the pigment at the time
of killing.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Anatomy.</i>&mdash;For a short epitome of the anatomy of a Cubomedusa
and of a Cubomedusan sensory club see <a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a> of the Introduction.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Distal Complex Eye</i>&mdash;<i>General</i>.&mdash;The distal (larger) complex eye
(<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>) and the proximal (smaller) complex eye (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>) are so
named to distinguish them from the lateral simple eyes of the clubs.
The distal complex eye consists of the following parts: a cellular
cornea, continuous with the epithelium of the sensory club; a cellular
lens (externally cellular and internally often quite homogeneous)
immediately beneath the cornea; a homogeneous capsule just internal
from the lens, and evidently a secretion from the lens cells; a
vitreous body composed primarily of prisms and pyramids just
beneath the capsule; and a retina of pigmented cells, with subretinal
nerve tissue, ganglion cells and fibers. To my knowledge
all observers (except Carrière, who missed the capsule) are quite
agreed on the anatomical structure of the distal complex eye as also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
on the proximal complex eye and the lateral simple eyes.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> It is on
the histological structure of some of the various parts that differences
exist.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Cornea.</i>&mdash;Little need be said on the cornea except that it consists
of flattened cells applied to the outer surface of the lens. It is
continuous with the epithelium of the club and evidently a modified
portion of this epithelium (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>). All observers conform to this
statement.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Lens.</i>&mdash;The lens is of cellular origin, but in its interior the
cells are often so changed&mdash;absence of nuclei, cell walls, and protoplasmic
structure&mdash;as to make a mass quite homogeneous and
structureless. While this internal mass sometimes shows practically
no structure, yet at other times it is found broken up into masses
much the size and shape of cells but without nuclei, while again,
cells with nuclei may be quite evident. This occasional breaking
up of this mass is evidently predetermined by its original cell
structure. Iron-hæmatoxylin stains this inner mass very dark and
it is difficult to wash out the stain. Borax carmine and Lyons
blue give the best results on the lenses. In <a href="#plate1">figure 7</a> the lens of
the distal complex eye is shown as quite homogeneous internally,
while in <a href="#plate2">figure 13</a> (proximal complex eye) it is drawn cellular. In
this latter lens the inner cells are quite round and nucleated as
they may also appear in the distal eye. What I have said applies
equally to the lenses of both complex eyes, though the cellular
nature of the inside of the lens is more readily demonstrated in
the proximal eye.</p>

<p>It appears that it is in younger specimens that the central mass
of the lens shows the cellular structure best, and that as the animal
grows older this structure is more and more lost until no trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of it remains. As concerns most of my series I could not well
determine which were from younger and which from older
individuals, yet, several series of quite small (5 mm.) and therefore
young animals, in which the eyes were so small that the lenses were
compassed into less than half a dozen sections, the cellular structure
of the lens was very evident.</p>

<p>The external cells of the lens form a spherical shell (both complex
eyes) which, in section, shows as a hollow ring (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">13</a>). The
thicker ends of these cells lie at the inner (toward the capsule) half
of the sphere and the cells taper toward the corneal surface, dovetailing
laterally with their immediate neighbors as also distally with
those from the opposite side of the sphere. The thicker inner ends
of the cells contain the large nuclei with nucleoli. At a point (* Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>
and <a href="#plate2">13</a>) on the inner (next the capsule) surface of the lens the cells only
approximate each other and thus leave a place which is easily
broken through, as is shown by portions (drops, probably representing
cells or portions of cells) of the mass within the lens becoming
squeezed out into the substance of the capsule and the vitreous body,
and found occasionally also among the cells of the retina. A
considerable portion of the inside of the lens may be found thus
squeezed out, and its path can often be traced. This phenomenon is
evidently brought about by a contraction of the shell of the lens
during fixation and before the inside of the lens has become
hardened.</p>

<p>In origin the lens is evidently ectodermal, originating from an
ectodermal invagination which becomes pinched off as a hollow
sphere, the outer (<i>i. e.</i> next the cornea) half of which becomes the
lens, the inner half the retina (<i>i. e.</i> vitreous body plus the so called
retina). (See Retina.) The transition from retinal to lens cells is
quite readily made out at the lower side of <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, but the corresponding
structure on the upper left side is not so manifest. It is
further evident that the lens is again an invagination into this
sphere, and the point at which the lens cells approximate (where the
central mass of the lens may be squeezed out as above described)
represents the place of pinching off of the original lens-retina sphere.
It appears, then, that the lens is formed in the lens-retina sphere in
the following manner: The cells of the secondary invagination
going to form the lens begin to lengthen distally (<i>i. e.</i> toward the
cornea) during their invagination to form a hollow sphere, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
same time dovetailing with each other and budding off cells to form
the inside of the lens (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate1">13</a>).</p>

<p>At the lower side of the lens, near the margin of the retina, the
cells of the lens are slightly indented or pushed inwards (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, ind.).
I believe this to be due to the weight of the lens in the normal
position of the club, when the lens rests against the margin of the
retina and the capsule and adjacent tissue.</p>

<p>Anticipating the description of the retina, it may here be added,
that the retina is formed from the inner half of the lens-retina sphere.
The cells of this portion of the sphere become differentiated into
prism cells, pyramid cells, and long pigment cells, while laterally,
beyond the margin of the vitreous body, they are differentiated into
pigmented iris cells (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 7, 6a</a>).</p>

<p>Above are my results on the lens. Haake<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book2">[2]</a></span> speaks of the lens as
consisting of a cellular “Kern” with a covering of lamellated cells.
Carrière describes it as cellular and filled internally with a “Gerinsel,”
or coagulation. Carrière and Haake are each in part right. Claus
describes it as wholly cellular. Schewiakoff regards the lens as wholly
cellular, and like Claus has not noted that internally this cell
structure may be quite obliterated. Schewiakoff regards the lens and
retina as formed from an invaginated sphere, and shows the
transition from the lens cells into retinal cells as I have figured.
Conant also gives the structure of the lens for the complex eyes as
cellular but missed the change of structure that the interior of the
lens may undergo.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Capsule.</i>&mdash;The capsule of the lens (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4, 7</a>) lies immediately
below (inward from) the lens. In structure it is homogeneous, except
for certain fibers from the long pigment cells of the retina that
traverse it, while sometimes also other fibers can be seen which,
possibly, are branches from the fibers just mentioned or continuations
from the fine fibers of the prism cells of the retina soon to be
described. I have, however, no evidence that the fibers from the
prism cells extend beyond the prisms in whose axis they lie. The
capsule lies very closely applied to the lens, never becoming separated
from it in sections, and is, hence, regarded as a secretion from the
lens cells. Just what its function may be is difficult to surmise.
The proximal complex eye possesses no capsule. I have thought,
however, that if the lens should be adjustable, the capsule might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
serve as a protection to the prisms of the vitreous portion of the
retina during the adjusting movements of the lens. (But more on this
below.) To my knowledge all previous observers are quite agreed
on the structure of the capsule. Carrière and Haake, however,
missed it altogether.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Retina.</i>&mdash;While I have enumerated (following previous observers)
the vitreous body and the so-called retina as distinct parts, yet, as
the sequel will show, they are, histologically, different parts of the
same thing&mdash;namely the sensorium proper of the eye&mdash;and I propose
to use the term retina for both taken together, while I retain the
expression vitreous body (as hitherto used) for the vitreous portion
of the retina. This simplifies matters; and using a word that is
already used for analogous structures of other eyes (vertebrates,
anthropods, molluscs) is conducive to clearness. I have been tempted,
furthermore, to use the words <em>rods</em> and <em>cones</em> for the prisms and
pyramids that I find in the vitreous bodies of the retinas of the complex
eyes. But since the prisms in reality approximate prisms and the
pyramids pyramids, in their shape, I have decided to retain the
words prism and pyramid for these structures. The former of these
terms (prism) was first used by Conant in his description of the
complex eyes.</p>

<p>What I shall call the retina, then, in the distal and proximal
complex eyes of Charybdea, consists of three kinds of elements:
the prism cells, the pyramid cells, and the long pigment cells. (Figs.
<a href="#plate1">4</a>, <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">22</a>, prc, pyrc, lp.) We may also describe the retina as composed
of three zones: the vitreous zone (vitreous body of authors),
the pigmented zone, and the nuclear zone. (Figs. <a href="#plate1">4</a>, <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">22</a>, vb, pz, nz.)</p>

<p>The cells composing the retina form a single layer in the shape
of a hollow cup, into which cup the lens with its capsule fits. (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>.)
This single layer of cells takes in the thickness of the vitreous zone,
the pigmented zone, and the nuclear zone. Indeed, the distinctions
vitreous zone (vitreous body), pigmented zone, and nuclear zone
characterize three topographical regions of the retinal cells.</p>

<p>That the retina is made up of three kinds of cells is most
readily demonstrated in transverse sections through the vitreous
body. <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a> is such a section, taken quite near the pigmented
zone (at about the level x, <a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a>). Three different kinds of areas
are readily made out in such a section. The more numerous areas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
(pr) are transverse sections of the distal prisms of the prism cells,
the less numerous and lighter areas (pyr) are transverse sections
of the pyramids of the pyramid cells, and the large oval heavily
pigmented areas (lp) are the transverse sections of the long pigment
cells. The dots within the two first named areas represent fine fibers
in the axes of the prism and pyramid cells, to be described below.
The presence of three kinds of cells can again be readily seen in
such Figs. as <a href="#plate1">4 and 7</a>, in which the elements of the retina are cut
parallel to their long axis. (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 22</a>.) Again, a transverse section
through the most distal part of the pigmented zone of a slightly
pigmented retina (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>) also shows us the presence of three kinds
of elements. The larger and more heavily pigmented areas (lp) are
the long pigment cells; the smaller, lighter areas (pyrc) with a
central dot are the pyramid cells, and the more numerous dots, with
no definite polygonal areas outlined about them (prc), belong to the
prism cells. Thus, I believe, we have conclusive evidence of the
existence of three kinds of cells in the retina of the distal complex
eye.</p>

<p>(a) The prism cells are the more numerous, and, as the name
implies, end distally in a vitreous polygonal prism (Figs. <a href="#plate1">4</a>, <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">22</a>, pr).
The prismatic structure of the vitreous body is also shown in <a href="#plate1">Figs.
10 and 11</a>, which are drawn from a macerated preparation of Conant’s.
(See the descriptions of these figures.)</p>

<p>In <a href="#plate1">Figs. 4 and 7</a> the prism cells correspond to the cells with
the darker nuclei (npr); in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a> they are represented by the dots
without defined polygonal areas about them (prc), and in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a> by
the most numerous areas (pr). These cells, then, consist of a centrad
portion with nucleus, a pigmented portion with granules of a dark-brown
pigment, distal from the nucleus, and a distal vitreous prism
which extends to the capsule of the lens.</p>

<p>In the axis of each prism is a fine darkly-staining fibril extending
the entire length of the prism. I found no good evidence that this
fiber extends into the capsule. Centrad this fiber is continued
through the pigmented part of its cell and approaches to or near
the nucleus (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>, dots without defined polygonal areas; <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>,
part of retina left unpigmented). In some instances I could trace
this fiber quite to the nucleus, while in others it ended before reaching
the nucleus or a little to one side of it. I am inclined to believe,
however, that it extends past the nucleus and is continued as a nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fiber. I believe this to be so because the fiber is evidently sensory,
and <i>a priori</i> we should expect it to be so continued. Further, I
find decided evidence in sections of the simple eyes to show that the
fibers there extend past the nucleus into the subretinal tissue where
I could not trace them farther. (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 16</a>.) Again, that the flagella
of the epithelial cells of the club are also continued into the cells,
in some instances could be traced past the nuclei (Figs. <a href="#plate2">12</a> and <a href="#plate3">26</a>),
and the fact, too, that the retinal cups of the eyes represent
invaginated epithelium (the axial fibers of the prisms are hence
cilia?)&mdash;all this leads me to believe that the axial fibers of the prism-cells
extend centrad past the nuclei through their cells and are
continued as nerve-fibers. (See below under pyramid-cells and under
epithelium). Immediately upon entering the pigmented part of its
cell the axial fiber of a prism-cell has a dumbbell-shaped enlargement
which lies quite at the distal edge of the pigmented part
of the cell (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, unpigmented part of figure). This, of course, can
be seen only in unpigmented retinas. This dumbbell-shaped body,
(Basalkörperchen of Apathy), which name I give it, since it evidently
is homologous to the basal bodies described by others for the cilia of
epithelia, can be most beautifully seen as two minute spheres lying
close together and in line with the nucleus. These two little spheres
of the basal bodies put to the test the highest powers of the
microscope; but, when, after a prolonged and careful study, one
satisfies himself of their existence and exact shape, the very difficulty
with which they are resolved adds a zest to be appreciated. The
length of a basal body is about one-fifth to one-fourth that of the
nuclei of the prism-cells.</p>

<p>The structure of the nuclei of the prism-cells is that of a dense
network (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4, 7</a>, npr) which stains dark with hæmatoxylin. A
nucleolus can often be seen in these nuclei. In some few series,
again, these nuclei did not show a network-like structure, but the
chromatin was arranged in masses (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a>, npr). These nuclei can
usually be distinguished from those of the other cells of the retina
by their denser, darker-staining network (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4, 7</a>, npr), or as
shown in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a> (npr). Their denser structure and staining capacity
are a distinguishing characteristic of the nuclei of the prism-cells.
I must add, however, that not in every series is this apparent.</p>

<p>That portion of a prism-cell that contains the nucleus rarely
contains any pigment; and when pigment is present, I believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it has been dissolved in from the pigmented zone. The nucleus,
again, lies a little centrad from the pigmented part of its cell, so that
an unpigmented zone is seen in the retina between the pigmented
zone and the row of nuclei (Figs. <a href="#plate1">4</a>, <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">22</a>).</p>

<p>Centrad the prism-cells are continued as a single process (<a href="#plate1">Figs.
6, b, c, d, and 8a, b, c, d</a>). In some sections I thought I could trace
these processes to the basement membrane, but I could not satisfy
myself that such appearances were not due to artificial splitting in
the tissue. Schewiakoff makes a similar remark about his supporting
cells, which cells I believe are the same as my long pigment cells,
but these do not extend to the supporting lamella.</p>

<p>At the margin of the retina the cells do not develop prisms but
remain pigmented and form an iris (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>), which was so named by
Claus and also described by Schewiakoff. These cells also assume a
somewhat different shape (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 6a</a>). This cell (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 6a</a>) is seen from
its broader side with which it is applied to the capsule or the lens.
Schewiakoff figures similar cells. That the cells of the iris are prism
cells without the prisms does not necessarily follow. They simply
represent cells of the retinal cup that have become differentiated to
serve as an iris.</p>

<p>As to the exact origin of the prisms, and pyramids (to be
described below), it is difficult to say anything definite. If the
so-called basal bodies of the axial fibers are really homologous with
the basal bodies of flagella, then it would seem that they (the prisms
and pyramids) are secretions comparable to cuticular secretions.</p>

<p>(b) The pyramid-cells, like the prism-cells, are differentiated
into three regions: a distal vitreous pyramid, a pigmented part, and
a centrad part with nucleus. The pyramids are seen in transverse
section in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a> (pyr) and in longitudinal section in <a href="#plate1">Figs. 4 and
7</a> (pyr).<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<p>Each pyramid extends between the bases of the prism-cells
about one-third to one-half the depth of the vitreous body (Figs.
<a href="#plate1">4</a>, <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">12</a> (pyr)). The pyramids are also a shade lighter than the prisms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which fact is characteristic. In the axis of each pyramid is a
darkly-staining fiber quite like the one described for the prism-cells
(Figs. <a href="#plate1">1</a>, <a href="#plate1">4</a>, <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">22</a>). That this fiber extends distally beyond the
limits of the pyramids I could not determine, but I do not think
that it does. Centrad this fiber extends into the pigmented portion
of its cell quite to or near the nucleus as was described for the
fibers of the prism-cells (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">22</a>). Whether or not these fibers
extend past the nucleus and become continued as nerve fibers, the
same course of reasoning holds as was given for the fibers of the
prism-cells. Each of these fibers possesses a basal body just on its
entrance into the pigmented part of the cell (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>), but I could
not determine that it was dumbbell-shape. In form it represents
an enlargement of the fiber itself, which gradually tapers again to
its normal size. The continuations of these fibers within the pigmented
parts of the pyramid-cells, as also the basal bodies, could
only be demonstrated in unpigmented series.</p>

<p>Patten<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book5a">[5]</a></span> describes axial fibers extending centrad through the rods
(vitreous portions) of retinal cells (“retinophora”) into the region
of the nucleus and past the nucleus (arthropods and molluscs). My
retinal cells (prism and pyramid cells) evidently correspond to Patten’s
retinophora, but I find no evidence that one of my retinal cells
represents more than a single cell, while Patten gives evidence that
his retinophora are made up of two cells closely applied to each other
as twin cells. If this were also true for the retinal cells that I have
described, I believe my macerated preparations would have shown
it. Schreiner<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book12b">[12b]</a></span> and Hesse<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book13">[13]</a></span> also figure and describe axial fibers for
the rods of the visual cells in polychætous annelids, and Schreiner<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book12a">[12a]</a></span>
also for molluscs. Neither of these observers finds the fibers to extend
distally beyond the rods nor centrad toward the nucleus as Patten
and myself show. Neither Schreiner nor Hesse figures these cells as
twin cells as Patten does, so that to my knowing Patten stands
alone in this respect. Andrews<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book14">[14]</a></span> describes and figures rods for the
visual cells of polychæte annelids but no axial fibers. He was the
first to describe these rods in annelids.</p>

<p>The pigmented zone of the pyramid cells, in heavily pigmented
series, is filled throughout with dark-brown pigment granules, and is
quite like that of the prism cells (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4, 7</a>). In transverse sections,
however, through the most distal part of the pigmented zone, of
unpigmented series (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>), lighter areas with central dots could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
occasionally be demonstrated, which areas are the pyramid cells. In
<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>, the more definite polygonal outline as well as the lighter shade
of these areas was a distinguishing feature. The difference in shade
was not wholly due to a difference in pigmentation but to a
structural difference.</p>

<p>The nuclei of these cells are usually a little larger than those of
the prism cells and are filled with a finer and less dense network
(<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4 and 7</a>, npyr), in consequence of which they present a lighter
appearance in sections when examined with a high power. It will be
seen in the figures (<a href="#plate1">4, 7</a>) with what regularity these lighter nuclei
lie opposite the pyramids. Some few exceptions occur. These are
probably due to the fact that a nucleus or pyramid was not differentiated
by the technique. If this opposition between the pyramids and
the lighter nuclei were all, I believe it would be sufficient evidence
for associating these lighter nuclei with the pyramid cells.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[f]</a></p>

<p>(c) The <em>long pigment cells</em> are about as numerous as the pyramid
cells. In these cells, as in the prism and pyramid cells, three regions
can be distinguished: the region of the nucleus, a pigmented region
(the distal half of which extends between elements of the vitreous
body), and a distal rod-like portion, or fiber, which is continued
between the prisms into the capsule of the lens (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4, 7, 9</a>). The
pigmented portion is about twice the length of that described for the
other cells, and also often of greater diameter, so that in transverse
sections (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 1, 2, 3</a>) these cell-areas are larger than those of the
other cells. As nearly as I could determine, these cells are pigmented
just like the other retinal cells described. In quite unpigmented series,
however, they often contain more pigment than the other cells do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
(<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>). Distally, the pigmented part becomes narrowed to a strong
pigmentless fiber (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 3, 4, 7</a>). This fiber stains quite dark with
iron-hæmatoxylin and appears homogeneous. It passes between the
prisms into the capsule, where it usually bends in a direction toward
the margin of the capsule (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>) and passes diagonally across this
to the lens. In sections, a space is often seen about these fibers in the
vitreous body, which I regard as a shrinkage space (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 3, 4</a>), since
it is not evident in all series (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>). In <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, I have assumed that
these spaces are due to shrinkage and have not indicated them. Also,
in this same figure I have assumed that the spiral appearance of the
fibers (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a>) is due to a shortening of the prisms during fixation,
and have drawn them straight. At the lens these fibers seem to
end. In a few instances they were seen to branch upon reaching
the capsule (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a>). In <a href="#plate1">Fig. 9</a>, also, which shows some of these cells
from a macerated preparation by Conant, the rods show evidence of
branching at their distal terminations. In the same preparation I
thought I could see that a fiber became expanded into a membrane
spreading over one of the lens-cells. I could not satisfy myself,
however, that this was the actual condition of things. Judging from
<a href="#plate1">Fig. 9</a>, one might conclude that all the fibers are branched distally;
yet, if such were the case I should have seen more of it in sections,
but branching as seen in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a> is the exception. Hence, if all these
fibers do branch, I am inclined to believe that it must be among the
bases of the lens-cells. Or, if the fibers do expand into membranes to
cover the lens-cells (I could not explain purpose), the evidence in
<a href="#plate1">Fig. 9</a> may be nothing more than fragments of this membrane left
attached to the ends of the fibers. As is seen in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, most of these
rods end opposite the cells of the lens, and not usually between two
adjacent cells as Schewiakoff has described for Charybdea marsupialis.
The nuclei of these cells are like the nuclei of the pyramid cells (<a href="#plate1">Figs.
4, 5, 7, 9</a>) and often have a nucleolus.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> Centrad these cells are
continued into a number of processes as is seen in <a href="#plate1">Figs. 5, 7 and 9</a>.
How far the several centrad processes extend and where they end I
cannot say; but, as seen in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a>, they soon taper to a thin end
which I suppose may be continuous with a nerve fiber. I believe
Schewiakoff was mistaken when he stated that these cells extend to
the basement membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>I have found no evidence in these cells of the existence of an
axial fiber such as I have described for the prism and pyramid cells.
I find no definite arrangement of the nuclei of the retina into definite
layers, but the nuclei of the three kinds of cells lie quite mixed,
sometimes one kind lying deeper than the other as can be seen in
the figures. Again, they may lie quite at the same level. (This
point will be referred to later.)</p>

<p>It is these long pigment cells that I believe retract their
pigmented part from between the prisms and pyramids when the
medusæ are placed in the dark, protruding with their pigment
when placed in the light. <a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a> is a section from a slightly
pigmented retina killed in the dark. The parts of the cells projecting
beyond the pigmented zone, and which would lie between
the prisms and pyramids (here not shown) of the vitreous body are
seen to be narrower than in sections from retinas killed in the light
(<a href="#plate1">Figs. 1, 3, 4, 7</a>) and the cells themselves appear in a condition of
retraction as is shown by their large centrad portions with the nuclei,
which latter, also, here lie at quite a lower level than the other nuclei.
(The pyramid cells were not shown in this series.) I occasionally
found appearances like <a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a> in retinas killed in the dark (indeed,
in some the pigmented portions in the vitreous body were much
thinner and more retracted than in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a>). Yet this appearance
was not of sufficiently general occurrence to leave no doubt as to
its significance. As positive evidence, however, I cannot give it any
other interpretation than the one given&mdash;that the cells retract
themselves with their pigment when in the dark. Again, it must
be added that the nuclei of these cells may occasionally lie quite
deep even in retinas killed in the light. Indeed, like structures in
different retinas may vary considerably in size and shape. None
of my darkness retinas, however, showed such a large proportion of
the pigmented parts of the long pigment cells projected between
the prisms and pyramids as did the light retinas. I examined
and tabulated all my series with respect to the extent the long
pigment cells were projected into the vitreous body, and I found
that those which showed these cells with their pigment least
projected between the prisms and pyramids to be those that had
been killed in the dark. I thus feel satisfied that the pigmented
parts of these cells become in part or quite completely retracted from
between the prisms and pyramids of the vitreous body when in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
dark, but just how this is accomplished&mdash;whether the whole cell with
its nucleus takes up a deeper position, the cell substance at the same
time collecting in the region about the nucleus, as shown in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a>
and the diagram (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 22</a>), I cannot with certainty state. It would
seem, too, as though the pigment became less in the cells exposed to
darkness, for I rarely, even in the most retracted heavily pigmented
series, saw the pigment to extend farther towards the nucleus than
commonly. The time of keeping in the dark, prior to fixing, varied
from three-fourths of an hour to one and one-half hours. I could
not bring the amount of retraction into relation with the time of
exposure, except that in general the retinas longest exposed showed
the greater amount of retraction.</p>

<p>(d) The tissue underlying the retina is described by former
observers (Claus, Schewiakoff, Conant) as composed of nerve-fibers
and ganglion cells. I cannot give it any other interpretation, but I
must add that the supposed ganglion cells are seen only as nuclei,
no cell bodies ever being demonstrable in any of my sections. Conant
also recognized no cell bodies. Occasionally, as in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, long fibers
could be traced for some distance in this subretinal tissue, in some
instances quite to or from a visual cell. Pigment was not regularly
observed in this tissue, as Schewiakoff describes, and when present I
believe it has been dissolved in from the pigmented zone.</p>

<p>(e) Schewiakoff describes the retina (my pigmented and nuclear
regions) as composed of spindle-shaped visual cells (my pyramid
cells?) alternating with pigmented supporting cells (long pigment
cells), with the nuclei of the former lying more centrad than those of
the latter. The visual cells are pigmented only at their periphery, or
surface, leaving an unpigmented axis, while the supporting cells have
pigment throughout their whole substance within the pigmented
zone. Distally, the visual cells have hyaline rods, or fibers, which
extend into spaces in the vitreous body, and pass through this and
the capsule to the lens. The vitreous body is described as homogeneous,
except the spaces for the visual rods, and a secretion from the
retinal cells.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that my results are quite different from
those just described. I find the vitreous body to be composed of
prisms and pyramids with axial fibers, while the long pigment
cells (supporting cells of Schewiakoff) are continued into the
vitreous body, and becoming narrowed into a non-pigmented fiber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
extend to the lens as described. The prisms and pyramids are,
further, the distal continuations of cells whose pigmented and
nuclear parts lie in the so-called retina, but which, together with the
vitreous body, I have named the retina proper. Conant has so summarily
disposed of Schewiakoff’s distinction between retinal cells based
on pigmentation and location of nuclei, that I need not say more.
Schewiakoff’s Fig. 18 corresponds to my <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>. In this figure he
shows the vitreous body as homogeneous with pigmented areas
(my long pigment cells) and with spaces with his visual rods. It is
quite evident that his spaces with the visual rods correspond to
my lighter areas with central dots; <i>i. e.</i> my pyramids of the
vitreous body are the same as the spaces shown in his Fig. 18.
It is quite evident that Schewiakoff mistook the lighter areas for
spaces. That they are not spaces can readily be seen by comparing
them with real spaces. It is, of course, possible, too, that the reagents
had dissolved the pyramids, leaving only the axial fibers with a little
pyramid substance about them, and that this is what Schewiakoff
saw. I often found small circular spaces in the centers of the
pyramid areas, as also in the prism areas (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a>), which might be
taken for hyaline visual rods, fibers, in transverse section, but in
such spaces I could usually see a small dot to one side of the space
that I take to be the rod (fiber) proper. <a href="#plate2">Fig. 14</a> also shows such
small circular spaces that have very much the semblance of hyaline
rods. This figure is a transverse section of the vitreous body of the
proximal complex eye, in which no long pigment cells or pyramid
cells are present, but it serves well to illustrate the point. The above
explanation also accounts for the large size of the visual rods (fibers)
in Schewiakoff’s figures. That the fibers of the pyramid cells (visual
rods of Schewiakoff) do not extend to the lens is quite evident in my
<a href="#plate1">Figs. 4 and 7</a>.</p>

<p>Again, since the long pigment cells are often not seen to terminate
in a fiber, but a part of the fiber can often be seen in the
distal part of the vitreous body and in the capsule, it will be quite
readily seen how Schewiakoff should associate his visual rods, or
fibers, with these distal parts of the fibers of the long pigment cells
and suppose his visual rods to extend to the lens.</p>

<p>Again, since the long pigment cells sometimes cannot be seen to
terminate distally in a fiber, while the vitreous body at the same
time may be broken away from the pigmented zone (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a>), it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
quite evident how Schewiakoff should have interpreted the parts of
the long pigment cells in the vitreous body as conical pigmented caps
placed opposite his supporting cells (long pigment cells).</p>

<p>Finally, since Schewiakoff had only twelve marginal bodies to
study, and since this tissue is difficult to preserve properly, I do not
believe that I am doing Schewiakoff any injustice by explaining away
his results as I have done. This fact remains, that Conant and
myself agree in all points in which we differ from Schewiakoff.</p>

<p>To Conant belongs the credit of having first demonstrated the
prismatic structure of the vitreous body, and he also regarded the
prisms as a part of the retinal cells. H. V. Wilson<span class="fnanchor">[<a href="#book15">15</a>, <a href="#book8b">8b</a>]</span> suggested,
however, some years prior to Conant, that the vitreous body might
be of a prismatic structure. Conant had evidence also of both the
prism and pyramid fibers, as is well shown in his figures of transverse
sections but he found his evidence too meager to make any
very definite statements. Indeed, Conant concludes that there are
three kinds of fibers in the vitreous body and complains of finding
but two kinds of cells in the so-called retina (pigmented and nuclear
zones) to which to refer them. He saw the pyramids with their
axial fibers as lighter areas in transverse sections of the vitreous
body (his Figs. 64 and 68, and my <a href="#plate1">Figs. 1, 4 and 7</a>), but suggests
that they may be the same as the long pigment cells, the cells
having only to project themselves or their pigment in order to
become long pigment cells. This suggested to him to preserve
material both in the light and in the dark. I do not think Conant’s
supposition to be a fact, for I find the pyramids in specimens
preserved in the light as well as in the dark. It is, of course,
possible that the pyramid cells are in a stage of structural transition
to the long pigment cells, for, besides their pigmentation, they also
have like nuclei. Furthermore, I held for a long time with Conant
that there may be only two kinds of cells in the retina, but I soon
found the pyramids so definitely shown as to leave no doubt but
that they represented a third kind of cell. For me it remained to
first definitely see all the fibers in the vitreous body as also the
pyramids in sagittal sections.</p>

<p>Conant describes the long pigment cells with their fibers extending
between the prisms of the vitreous body quite as I have described,
and in this my work is only confirmatory of his. Conant does not,
however, describe the several centrad processes of these cells, nor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he clear that their distad processes extend to the lens, though he
speaks of fibers within the capsule.</p>

<p>(f) What, now, is the function of these three varieties of cells
of the retina? Schewiakoff regards his visual cells (pyramid cells),
as the name implies, as having a visual function. That they have
such it seems reasonable to suppose, since they have an axial fiber
in their pyramids. If the pyramid cells are visual cells, it appears
that the prism cells also are such. Indeed, since these are the only
ones present in the proximal eye and the more numerous ones in the
distal eye, and like the pyramid cells have an axial fiber in their
prisms, it seems that they are the visual cells <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of the
Cubomedusan eye. Also, the analogy between the prisms and
pyramids on the one hand, and the rods and cones of the vertebrate
eye on the other hand, does not seem to be so far fetched. It may
be of interest, here, to briefly consider Patten’s theory of color
vision.<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book5b">[5b]</a></span></p>

<p>The gist of Patten’s theory is this: In the eyes of certain
molluscs and arthropods, in the parts of the retinal cells corresponding
to my prisms and pyramids, he not only finds an axial
fiber (or fibers) but finer fibrils that extend at right angles from
these axial fibers to the surface of the rods (I shall here, for
convenience, call the prisms, pyramids, etc., rods) where they probably
become continuous with other fibrils in the surface of the rods.
These fibrils from the axial fibers are arranged in superimposed
planes, and if I understand rightly, an axial fiber with its radiating
fibrils may be compared to the axial wire with its radiating bristles
of a brush used for cleaning bottles, provided the bristles of such
a brush be arranged in superimposed planes. The lateral arrangement
of the fibrils will, of course, be modified according whether
a rod is circular, hexagonal, square, etc., in transverse section. It
will also be remembered (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>) that Patten describes the retinal
cells studied by him as composed of twin cells, and he gives the
name <em>retinophora</em> to a pair. The system of fibers and fibrils in the
rods he names a <em>retinidium</em>. Centrad the axial fibers are continued
past the nucleus as a nerve fiber. The fibrils extending laterally in
superimposed planes from the axial fiber of a rod, Patten supposes
to be the ones stimulated by the incoming rays of light, the
retinophora being so arranged that the light rays entering them are
parallel to the axial fibers or perpendicular to the lateral fibrils of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
retinidium. Again, since the rods are usually the shape of truncated
pyramids or cones the lateral fibrils, which are perpendicular to the
axial fibers, are of different lengths accordingly as they are situated
at the larger or smaller end of a rod. Patten assumes similar fibrils
to exist in the rods and cones (particularly the cones) of the vertebrate
eye, and he thus makes a general application of his theory.
He supports himself in this rather sweeping generalization by the
claim to have demonstrated the twin-cell nature of the cones in
amphibia and fishes.</p>

<p>For illustration, Patten supposes that if red light only were
admitted to the retinophora this would stimulate the fibrils near the
broader end of the cone (but that all the fibrils of the retinidium
would be stimulated a little) and that we would thus have the
sensation of red light. Likewise, if violet light only were admitted,
the fibrils at the narrower end of the cone would be stimulated, and
we should have violet light. Similarly, if light including all the
different wave lengths of the spectrum were admitted, all the lateral
fibrils would be stimulated and the sensation of white light produced.
The method of stimulation need not be that of a vibration of the
fibrils.</p>

<p>Certain grave objections may be raised against such a theory,
the most serious, perhaps, being the fact that no such fibrils as
Patten has described have as yet been demonstrated for the eyes of
those animals that we know have color vision. Yet, as a whole, the
objections are perhaps no more serious than any that can be brought
against other theories of color vision. What Patten’s theory does do,&mdash;it
gives us a definite mechanical basis to work from, and if these
fibrils should be demonstrated for the rods and cones of vertebrates,
physiologists would then have a mechanical basis for color vision
quite as they now have for hearing. As Patten says, the problem
is primarily a mechanical one. However, the theory cannot well
pass for more than a suggestion, a stimulus for future work, and in
this lies its present value.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that my results for the retinal cells of
Charybdea are, if any thing, a support to Patten’s theory. While I
have not been able to demonstrate the fibrils that are the essential
to Patten’s theory, yet I have demonstrated the axial fibers of the
rods, and if these fibers should be continued as a nerve fiber to some
central ganglion (as I believe is reasonable to suppose, see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>), I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
do not see how we can avoid the conclusion that these axial fibers
of the prism and pyramid cells are somehow concerned in vision.
In Patten’s theory these fibers would represent a conducting element,
the real sensory element (fibrils perpendicular to these axial fibers)
not having been demonstrated by me.</p>

<p>I have recently read in a short review of Patten’s theory<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book9">[9]</a></span> that
the evidence we at present have points to the tips of the cones
(vertebrate eye) as being the seat of the sensation of red. This would
be exactly the converse of what Patten’s theory supposes. Whether
or not this objection is a real one, future investigation only can
determine.</p>

<p>Hesse<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book13">[13]</a></span> regards the axial fibers that he describes for the rods in
worms as the primitive fibers of Apathy. In this I agree with him,
regarding the axial fibers I have described as “Primitivfibrillen.”
Further, I believe, if I understand Apathy rightly, that the fibrils
described by Patten as extending laterally from the axial fibers
correspond to Apathy’s “Elementarfibrillen.”</p>

<p>It is the long pigment cells that are the puzzling element. Since
there can be little doubt but that these cells can project and retract
their pigmented parts (as already described), it would seem that a
part of their function is to check the diffusion of light in the vitreous
body when exposed to strong light. This function would be quite
analogous to that of the pigmented cells of the vertebrate retina,
which in light become projected between the rods and cones. Similar
observations have also been made on the compound eyes of arthropods
by Herrick<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book10">[10]</a></span> and by Parker<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book7">[7]</a></span>, who find that the distal retinula cells of
Palæmonites project themselves distad in the dark, thus surrounding
the vitreous cones with a cylinder of pigment, while (Parker) the
pigment of the proximal retinula cells migrates centrad and the
accessory cells move distad; in light the reverse takes place. Other
observations of this kind are not wanting for crustacea, insects and
arachnids. To my knowledge, the pigment changes that I have
described are the first of their kind for medusæ.</p>

<p>I suggested while describing the capsule, that the lens might be
adjustable. That the fibers of the long pigment cells extend to the
lens is my principal reason for this. May these cells not represent
ganglion cells and their distad fibers nerve fibers? That they are not
sensory (<i>i. e.</i> are stimulated by light waves) seems to be suggested by
their not having any axial fiber and in having several centrad processes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
These facts suggest that they are not sensory but the center
of a reflex mechanism.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[h]</a> When the sensory cells proper are stimulated,
the impulses are conducted centrad into some nerve center (it may
be the nerve tissue underlying the retina, or other nerve centers such
as the two groups of ganglion cells in the upper part of the club, or
the radial ganglia) from which center, again, impulses return over
fibers leading to the long pigment cells causing them to project their
pigment, and conducting the impulse to the lens, to produce a change
in its adjustment. Since these cells are not so numerous as the
prism and pyramid cells taken together, but in turn have a number
of processes continued centrad (the sum of which processes approximates
the number of sensory cells, prism and pyramid cells) it
appears that these cells are admirably adapted to function in just
such a mechanism as I have described,&mdash;each long pigment cell
serving a number of its immediate neighbors.</p>

<p>Further, we may conceive each of the centrad processes of the
long pigment cells as receiving a fiber from one of the sensory
cells directly as well as indirectly, as just described. While I
have been able to demonstrate only a single centrad process for the
sensory cells (prism and pyramid cells), yet this does not exclude the
possibility of a nerve fibril passing out from such a centrad process
to one of the processes of the long pigment cells, and it seems
possible that this constitutes the reflex mechanism. That nerve fibrils
ramify in ganglion and sensory cells, and may even leave these cells
to join those of other cells, has been well demonstrated by Apathy,<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book6">[6]</a></span>
so that my finding only a single process of the visual cells leading
centrad without giving off lateral fibers cannot be a serious objection.
Again, fine nerve fibers coming off from the main centrad process of
sensory cells in medusæ have been figured by other observers, among
whom I mention the Hertwigs. Careful macerations at the seashore
would probably demonstrate them for Charybdea.</p>

<p>Hesse thinks that the eyes of the Alciopidæ are adjustable. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
describes what he supposes to be muscle fibers just exterior (distal)
to the lens, and believes that a contraction of these fibers would
have the effect of forcing the lens nearer the retina, or <i>vice
versa</i>. His supposition, like mine, needs experimental verification.
Hitherto the only instance known of accommodation in the eyes of
invertebrates was that described by Beer<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book17">[17]</a></span> for Cephalopods.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Proximal Complex Eye.</i>&mdash;With four exceptions, the description
and discussion given for the distal complex eye also holds good for
the proximal complex eye (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>). The four exceptions are: the
absence of a capsule to the lens; the absence of the long pigment
cells; the absence of the pyramid cells; and the different relative
position of the lens and retina. This eye, then, has a cornea
continuous with the epithelium of the sensory club, a lens, in
structure and probable origin quite like that described for the distal
complex eye, and a retina of prism cells with axial fibers for the
prisms. Since Conant<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book8b">[8b]</a></span> has described this eye quite fully, and
discussed Schewiakoff’s conclusions at length, I shall be brief.
Suffice it to say, that Schewiakoff describes two kinds of cells
(supporting cells and spindle-shaped visual cells) for the retina of
this eye just as he described for the distal complex eye. The
vitreous body he likewise describes as being homogeneous and with
spaces for the visual rods (fibers) of the visual cells. It is evident
that Schewiakoff has interpreted the structure of this eye from
analogy with his results on the distal complex eye. Claus likewise
has described two kinds of cells for the retina, and the vitreous
body as homogeneous. Conant and myself find only one kind of
cells in the retina of this eye. The pigmentation that Schewiakoff
describes for the vitreous body I believe to have been dissolved in
from the pigmented zone of the retina, for I find no regular
pigmentation in the vitreous body. Haake’s observation, previously
noted (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>), applies also to the proximal complex eye.</p>

<p>Conant’s evidence for the axial fibers of the prisms was clearly
insufficient, so that he did not in this respect complete his Fig. 69.
I republish this figure with the prism fibers drawn (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<p>Since the long pigment cells are absent my reasons for supposing
the lens of this eye to be adjustable vanish.</p>

<p>Finally, a word on the origin of the lens and the relative
position of the lens and retina. The lens and retina in this eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
are evidently not developed from an outer and an inner half,
respectively, of the invaginated and pinched-off lens-retina sphere
(as is true for the distal complex eye) but from proximal and distal
halves respectively. It is also quite easy to understand the
connection of the lens in this eye with the supporting membrane.
Since the cells of the ectoderm of the club can in many instances
be seen to extend to the basement membrane, or supporting lamella,
the cells of the lens, which arise from the ectoderm, simply remain
in connection with the basement membrane, this becoming thickened
to form a support for the lens. That the lens of the distal complex
eye has lost its connection with the basement membrane is evidently
due to the fact that the lens is formed from the outer half of the
lens-retina sphere. The cells of the lens are by this so far separated
from the basement membrane as to lose their connection with it.
Schewiakoff also notes the fact that the lens and retina of the
proximal complex eye are developed from proximal and distal halves
of the lens-retina sphere. He further supposes that the portion of
the basement membrane that acts as a support to the lens takes the
place of the capsule in the distal complex eye. This latter supposition
I do not think probable, since the supporting lamella does not form
a distinct covering to the lens on its retinal side.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Simple Eyes.</i>&mdash;Since the shape and position of these eyes
have already been described (Claus, Schewiakoff, Conant), I shall not
tarry long in this respect. Speaking generally, these eyes are flask-shaped
(<a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>), the proximal pair quite so, while the distal pair are
drawn out in the transverse diameter of the club. These eyes are
invaginations of the surface epithelium and the shape of the cells
lining these invaginations is quite like that of the epithelial cells,
except that their distal portions (bordering the lumen of the invagination)
are heavily pigmented. The proximal walls (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>, left side)
of the distal pair are heavier pigmented than the distal walls and the
proximal pair of eyes. Schewiakoff calls attention to this point.
The pigmentation is, furthermore, not only heavier, but the pigmented
portion of each cell is much longer in the proximal walls of the
distal eyes (indeed, the cells are longer) than in the distal walls.
The significance of this I do not understand. Indeed, I am inclined
to believe that in life all these eyes are pigmented quite alike and
that it is the reagents used that alter or dissolve the pigment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
certain places. Yet, the fact that the cells of the proximal walls
of the distal eyes have their pigmented portions nearly double the
usual length, shows some deeper significance.</p>

<p>I also note here the small secondary, non-pigmented invagination
into the tissue of the clubs from each of the distal simple eyes.
Schewiakoff describes this invagination, and it extends in a proximal
and dorsal direction (dorsal-side of club opposite complex eye) from
the dorsal sides of the distal simple eyes. The cells of these
invaginations are not pigmented, but quite like the other pigmented
cells in shape, and like these with distal flagellate fibers. I do not
see the necessity of assuming, however, that these secondary invaginations
are the real sensitive parts of these eyes, while the pigmented
parts serve as an iris, as Schewiakoff does in his general discussion.</p>

<p>The histological structure of both pairs of simple eyes is the
same. Sections and macerations give me evidence of only one kind
of cells, all pigmented alike (except, of course, the non-pigmented
secondary invaginations just noted). The cells in these eyes are
very closely crowded so that their nuclei lie at several different
levels. That they all extend to the lumen of the eyes and are all
pigmented could be demonstrated with certainty in many sections,
when some of these cells whose nuclei lay most centrad could be
followed with the greatest nicety to the lumen (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>). Macerations
(<a href="#plate1">Figs. 8</a>, unlettered cells <a href="#plate3">21</a>) also show cells with very long cell bodies
pigmented at their distal ends and occasionally with a distal process
or fiber. While there are, therefore, spindle-shaped cells found, yet
they are in every other respect alike, and their differences of shape
and position of nuclei are simply the result of crowding. There is,
therefore, no evidence of supporting (pigmented) cells and spindle-shaped
visual cells (pigmented only externally) as Claus and
Schewiakoff have described and which Conant and myself cannot
corroborate.</p>

<p>Distally, the retinal cells of the simple eyes have each a fiber
(flagellum) that extends into the lumen (Figs. <a href="#plate2">12</a>, <a href="#plate2">15</a>, <a href="#plate2">16</a>, <a href="#plate3">21</a>). Each
flagellum has a dumbbell-shaped basal body just on its entrance into
its cell quite like the basal bodies described for the visual cells of
the complex eyes (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>, part left unpigmented). Each flagellum,
or fiber, can usually be seen to extend into the cell. In one series I
found appearances like <a href="#plate2">Fig. 16</a>, which is a drawing of a part of a
section through one of the proximal simple eyes. This section is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
quite in the angle between the proximal complex eye and the group
of network cells in the upper part of the club. In this series I
could very definitely trace the distal fibers of the retinal cells
centrad, past the nucleus and into the subretinal nerve-tissue.
These fibers could be so easily followed that no doubt can exist as
to the fact noted. It thus appears that the axial fibers just
described pass centrad through the cells and are continued as nerve
fibers. On the evidence of such sections as <a href="#plate2">Fig. 16</a> I have indicated
these fibers as extending centrad through their cells. The lumen of
the simple eyes is filled with a homogeneous vitreous secretion.
This is often incomplete in some parts; occasionally the secretion
shows a formation of globules, but all this I believe to be due to
the action of reagents. Indeed, I have found simple eyes in which
hardly any secretion was present, while others showed an almost
completely filled cavity. In that portion of the vitreous secretion
just outside the mouth of the distal eyes I occasionally found numbers
of very darkly staining granules. I suspect that these are either
bacterial or algal organisms.</p>

<p>As already noted, Claus and Schewiakoff describe two kinds of
cells for the retinas of these eyes which neither Conant nor myself
can demonstrate. Further, I believe I have shown that only one kind
exists. If any doubt should still exist, a section like <a href="#plate3">Fig. 25</a> (which
is from the epithelium of the club, but similar smaller areas with
central dots could often be demonstrated in transverse sections of the
retinal cells of the simple eyes) I believe should be convincing.
Schewiakoff further describes flagella for the retinal cells (his visual
cells) of the simple eyes quite as I have described them for all the
cells. The pigmentation that Schewiakoff mentions as occurring in
the secretions within the lumina of these eyes I believe to have
been dissolved in from the pigmented zones. I find no definite pigmentation
in these vitreous secretions. These secretions are evidently
products of the retinal cells and have been so regarded by former
observers.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Lithocyst and Concretion.</i>&mdash;The cavity filled by the concretion is
lined in places by a single layer of cells, two of which are shown in
<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>. This fact has been noted by both H. V. Wilson and Conant.
Such cells are evidently remnants of the cells that formed the concretion.
The supporting lamella completely surrounds the cavity of
the concretion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The concretion filling the lithocyst has the shape of a hemiprolate
spheroid cut in the plane of the axis of revolution. Whether
it is of endo- or of ectodermal origin, I believe developmental studies
only can determine. Tests made in the Chemical Laboratory show
the presence of calcium sulphate with perhaps a very small trace of
phosphate.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[i]</a> Nitric acid slowly dissolves these concretions, but I
believe Claus was mistaken when he said that they dissolve with an
evolution of gas. I watched them dissolve under the microscope, and
never could see the least bit of gas formed. If Claus’s observation is
correct, then the composition of the concretions of C. marsupialis is
different from that of the concretions of C. Xaymacana. The concretions,
further, were dissolved out of the material preserved in formaline
and in osmic acid solutions. For dissolving them in situ I used either
nitric or hydrochloric acid, or both. A slight husk remains after all
the lime is dissolved.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Epithelium of the Clubs.</i>&mdash;The epithelium is thickest on the
dorsal side of a club. The thickening here, as in several other
places, seems to be due to a crowding of the cells, in consequence of
which the nuclei come to lie at different levels, but I believe that all
the cells quite reach the surface. The cells with their nuclei nearest
the surface are pyramidal in shape, with the bases of the pyramids
toward the surface, while those cells whose nuclei lie deeper (where
several layers of nuclei occur) may be spindle-shaped (Figs. <a href="#plate2">12</a>, <a href="#plate3">23,
24, 26</a>). Centrad these cells are continued into a single process, which
often seems to extend to the basement membrane (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">12, 13</a>, <a href="#plate3">23,
24</a>). Where the epithelium covers the region of the concretion, the
cells become flattened and with the long axis of their nuclei parallel
with the surface of the club (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>). The same holds true for the
corneal epithelium (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">13</a>).</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that in many places the nuclei form only
a single layer, and in such places one cannot speak of spindle-shaped
cells. I cannot find any evidence of sensory and supporting cells as
Schewiakoff describes. The fact that spindle-shaped cells may exist
is simply a physical consequence of their being closely crowded.
Conant arrived at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>But I have another and better reason for supposing the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of only one kind of cells in the epithelium. In a tangential section
taken just through the tips of the epithelial cells (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 25</a>) I find
polygonal areas with a central dot. This section does not at all agree
with Schewiakoff’s Fig. 8, in which he figures two kinds of cells. In
<a href="#plate3">Fig. 25</a> there can be no evidence of two kinds of cells, unless both
kinds have like flagella, for these dots are the transverse sections of
flagella continued within the cells (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p>The epithelium, then, is flagellate, a flagellum to a cell. Whether
there are flagella on the epithelium covering the region of the concretion,
I could not determine. But I believe that in all other parts,
excepting, of course, the corneas, it is flagellated. The fibers (flagella)
of the simple eyes are evidently the flagella of the invaginated
epithelium. Each flagellum has a basal body, and I could in many
instances determine that it was dumbbell-shaped (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>). This fact
was not always evident, however, and it was only occasionally that I
felt sure of it. Often the flagella showed only a general thickening
within the cells (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 26</a>) while, again, the thickening (basal body)
might be quite localized near the surface of the cell. Each flagellum
extends into its cell, and occasionally I could trace one clear past the
nucleus into the subepithelial nerve-tissue (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 26</a>), just as I did for
the axial fibers of the retinal cells of the simple eyes. In those
instances in which I could do this, the fibers could so clearly be
traced that little if any doubt can exist. I have thus made bold
and have drawn the flagella as continued through their cells into the
subepithelial nerve-tissue for all the cells of the epithelium of <a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p>A word on the epithelium covering the network cells of <a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>.
Conant and Schewiakoff here describe fibers from the supporting
lamellæ that pass in bundles in among the network cells. These
fibers are supposed to be a part of the supporting lamella which
reaches out to be a support for the epithelial cells. (Schewiakoff also
describes similar fibers for other parts of the epithelium.) Now, as
Conant himself shows in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>, these coarse fibers are not of the
same consistency and staining capacity as the supporting lamella. I
found them to stain just like the intracellular parts of the flagella or
like the central continuations of the axial fibers of the cells of the
simple eyes. I could, also, occasionally trace them to the surface of
the epithelium, and beyond, when they became continued as short
blunt processes or flagella (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>). I, therefore, conclude that they
are sensory fibers like those I have described for the other epithelial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
cells. Yet, that they pass to the supporting lamella, just as Conant
shows in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>, would seem to indicate that they are fibers from
the supporting lamella or processes of the epithelial cells. While this
stands as an objection to their being sensory fibers, yet I cannot
explain away their being continued distally as a flagellum, except I
assume this continuation to be an artefact. This does not seem
probable. Perhaps they serve both purposes; namely, that the cell
body with its axial fiber is continued to the supporting lamella, the
cell proper ending there, while the axial fiber is continued as a nerve
fiber. I believe this to be the proper explanation.</p>

<p>The epithelium of the peduncle is quite like the epithelium of the
club just described. Sections through the tips of the epithelial cells
of the peduncle and also sections sagittal to the axis of these cells
give sections like <a href="#plate3">Figs. 25 and 26</a>. I, therefore, conclude that this
epithelium is a sensory flagellate epithelium like that of the clubs.
Nerve tissue and unstriped muscle fibers underly the epithelium of
the peduncles. Claus and Conant also describe a small ventral endodermal
tract of nerve tissue, which according to Conant is connected
with the endodermal nerve tissue found in the region of the radial
ganglia.</p>

<p>To sum up, the epithelium of the club and the peduncle is a
flagellate sensory epithelium whose flagella are continued through
the cells as nerve fibers into the nerve tissue below. <i>A priori</i>,
judging from the mass of nerve tissue underlying the epithelium,
we should expect the epithelium to be one strictly sensory. What
sense it serves is difficult to surmise. In the physiological part of
this paper I suggested that it might be tactile, serving in connection
with the lithocysts in giving the animal sensations of space relations.</p>

<p>Claus mentions having seen patches of flagella on the epithelium
of the clubs. Schewiakoff supposes that his spindle-shaped sensory
cells have only a single flagellum, while his supporting cells have
many cilia. In the latter supposition he was evidently mistaken.
Conant (from an unpublished note) saw the flagella of the epithelium
on the living object and does not think that there could be more
than a single one to each cell. He also concludes from living specimens
squeezed out under a cover-glass, that there is only one kind
of cells in the ectoderm.</p>

<p>Cilia and flagella extending into the cells to which they are
attached are described by a number of observers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not endeavor to discuss the subject further, but shall
append the literature on the subject that has come to my notice.
(See <a href="#LITERATURE">Literature</a>). Some of these observers ascribe a nervous function
to these centrad continuations. I am inclined to believe that they
represent the primitive fibrils of Apathy, whether the cilia or flagella
are motile or sensory. I should mention, however, that Apathy has
traced the “Primitivfibrillen” to be continuous with cilia, and also
traces them into the sensory rods of the sensory cells in the sense
organs of leeches. Eimer also describes cilia as continued centrad.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Network Cells and the Multipolar Ganglion Cells.</i>&mdash;Conant is
the first to accurately describe the true structure of the network
cells (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>) that fill the upper part of the club between the
proximal complex eye and the attachment of the peduncle. I cannot
add anything to Conant’s description. As their name implies, they
are filled with a coarse network-like structure with a central nucleus
and nucleolus. Schewiakoff erroneously described them as ganglion
cells and Claus as supporting cells. I have sometimes thought that
they are not made up of a network, but of a vesicular structure;
<i>i. e.</i> the network we see is really produced by the sections of
planes that intersect to form little polyhedral cavities. I could not,
however, satisfy myself on this point. I further saw similar but
smaller cells, with a finer network, disposed in small groups laterally
and distally from the attachment of the peduncle to the club.</p>

<p>What the function of these network cells is can only be guessed.
In size and shape they somewhat resemble some of the cells found
in luminous organs. Conant, however, nowhere mentions that
Charybdea is luminous.</p>

<p>Lateral to the larger group of network cells lie two groups of
large multipolar ganglion cells (a group on each side). Claus
describes these cells, but Schewiakoff does not specially note them,
and evidently considered them a part of the network cells, which
he erroneously described as ganglion cells.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Nerve Tissue.</i>&mdash;I cannot add anything new on this. It
consists of fine fibers and ganglion cells, quite as described by Claus,
Schewiakoff, and Conant, and fills the club between the ampulla
and the epithelium, except the spaces occupied by the eyes, lithocyst,
and network cells. It is likewise present under the ectoderm of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
peduncle, where also a small tract is found under the endoderm.
(See preceding head, or Claus<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book3">[3]</a></span>, and Conant<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book8b">[8b]</a></span>). As already noted,
under the distal complex eye, I find only large nuclei to represent
the ganglion cells. By saying this, however, I do not wish to dispute
their ganglionic nature. The large multipolar ganglion cells I have
noted under the preceding topic.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Supporting Lamella.</i>&mdash;The supporting lamella is a continuation,
through the peduncle, of the jelly of the bell. It completely
surrounds the ampulla and the lithocyst, and also forms a partition
between them, so that, as already noted, the lithocyst becomes
completely surrounded by it. It also sends a partition ventrally
between the complex eyes (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">13</a>). Its thickening to form a
support for the lens of the proximal complex eye has already been
noticed. I shall limit myself in the discussion of the supporting
lamella to the above short resumé, since Schewiakoff gives further
detail.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Endothelium of the Ampulla and the “Floating Cells.”</i>&mdash;The
ampulla is lined by a secreting epithelium. This is shown by the
large masses of a secretion within the bases of the cells, and by
smaller masses scattered in the central and more distal parts
(Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, and <a href="#plate3">27</a>, lower half). The section of the cells is such in <a href="#plate1">Fig.
7</a>, that the bases of some (those nearest the supporting lamella) are
taken, the central nuclear region of others, and the tips of those
farthest from the supporting lamella. The section may be said to be
taken diagonally through the bases and central parts of some of the
cells, but owing to the curvature of the ampulla wall, through the
tips of others. The secretion is a colloid substance, staining yellowish
gray with iron-hæmatoxylin, blue with Lyons blue, and reddish
with borax-carmine. Sometimes darkly staining rods and fibers of
unknown origin could be seen within the larger masses of the
secretion (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>). These rods and fibers could also be seen in
spaces within the cells, from which the secretion had evidently been
dissolved. I think there can be no question but that the masses
described are a secretion. Many series, however, do not show it;
indeed, an examination of Conant’s slides gave me little evidence
of a secreting function, though I could demonstrate it in his sections
both within the endothelium and also the floating bodies. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
presence or absence of this secretion is evidently correlated with the
feeding habits of the animals, or else it would be more generally
present.</p>

<p>The endothelium is thickest (the cells are longest) in the upper
part of the ampulla where the supporting lamella approaches the
lens of the proximal complex eye, and in the lower portion of the
ampulla (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>), in the angle between the concretion cavity and
the region of the distal complex eye. In general, the cells are
longest in the upper part of the ampulla, while in the lower part,
especially where they cover the concretion cavity and the dorsal
wall, they may be quite cubical instead of columnar. Often they
present a vacuolated appearance at their bases (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>). Claus and
Schewiakoff describe and figure this endothelium, but not in detail.
No one, to my knowledge, has described this secretory function.</p>

<p>The nuclei of these cells are peculiar. They may contain a
network with a nucleus (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>). Again, they may show evidence
of amitotic division (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>, h, i, j). Indeed, Remak’s scheme (Wilson<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book18">[18]</a></span>
“The Cell,” p. 46) can be quite readily demonstrated. It is,
however, such dumbbell-shaped, elliptical, or ringed nuclei as seen
in Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a> and <a href="#plate2">20</a> that are of special interest.</p>

<p>I have spoken of some of these nuclei as dumbbell-shaped,
elliptical, or ringed. This is so, however, only in sections. They are
really flattened spheres with a rod of tissue, of the same structure
as the nuclear wall, stretching between the poles. One may conveniently
compare the shape of these nuclei with that of an apple,
the core of the apple representing the rod connecting the two opposite
flattened or slightly hollowed poles of the nucleus. For convenience
I shall call the rod connecting the two poles the axis of the
nucleus. The dumbbell or elliptical shape would be obtained by a
meridional section through the axis (Figs. <a href="#plate2">20</a>, a, b, c, e, g, k, l, m, n,
o, <a href="#plate1">7</a>). Likewise a ringed appearance with a central dot would be
obtained by a section parallel with the flattened surfaces or perpendicular
to the axis (Figs. <a href="#plate2">20</a>, d, <a href="#plate1">7</a>). In a section not strictly meridional
the axis would be cut as in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 29</a>, a, or not show at all. As nearly
as I could determine, the inside of these nuclei is a vacuole, which
the axis penetrates.</p>

<p>The walls and axis of these nuclei have the structure of a very
fine and dense network that stains very dark with iron-hæmatoxylin.
It stains quite like the reticulum of any nucleus, but is very dense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as though all the reticulum of the nucleus had been crowded together
at the surface. Judging from appearances like p (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>), the
hollowing out, so to speak, of these nuclei, would seem to be a
process of vacuolation, the reticulum becoming crowded aside to the
surface. But how, on this view, to amount for the formation of the
axis, I do not know. Perhaps the axis is formed by a pushing in of
two opposite poles of a nucleus, the two invaginations meeting and
fusing. On this supposition one might expect the axis to be hollow
(cylindrical), but I could not determine that it was. Perhaps the
centrosphere (or spheres) (see the next paragraph) has something to
do with the formation of the axis (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>, b, g, e, etc.).</p>

<p>In the nuclei of <a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a> with the dark outlines, and of <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>
a small reticular body is seen just opposite one end of the axis, or
opposite both ends in g. In d (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>) this body is seen next the
axis just below (outside) the hollow cup represented by the hollow
ring. In this instance a central granule is seen in the reticular
body, as also in c. I take this reticular body to be the centrosphere,
and the central granule in c and d the centrosome. In k, l, m, n,
and o (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>), which are from another series, in which the walls
of the nuclei did not stain so dark as in the other nuclei of the
same figure, a nucleolus could be definitely seen, indeed, sometimes
quite perched upon the wall of the nucleus (k, l). In several
instances I could see two nuclei, as in o. But besides these nucleoli,
I could in several instances see quite definitely a reticular body
(centrosphere) opposite the axis (m, n, o) quite as I described for the
nuclei with the dark outlines. In a, b, c, d, e and g the nuclei could
not be so readily demonstrated, but I could occasionally see a darker
stained body as in a, c and g, that I have no doubt is the nucleolus,
which here, again, is perched quite upon the surface of the nucleus.
This position of the nucleolus is perhaps due to its having been
crowded to one side by the nucleus becoming hollow. It is no
uncommon thing, either, to find several nuclei in a single cell,
sometimes in process of division or just divided as o and e (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>),
also h, i and j. The whole nuclear phenomenon that I have described
seems to be one of division. Perhaps it is somehow associated with
the giving off of the secretion of the cells, for these nuclei seem to
be found in greatest abundance in those cells in which the secretion
is most abundant. In Conant’s sections I found but little evidence of
these nuclear phenomena as also little secretion, which all goes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
show the association of the nuclear phenomenon with the secretion.
I have failed to find any descriptions in the literature of nuclei to
which I could refer my observations.</p>

<p>The endothelium of the ampulla is flagellated (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">17</a>, <a href="#plate3">27</a>).
It will be seen that there are two slender flagella to a cell. Each
pair of flagella has a pair of basal bodies that are longer than thick,
and which are continued as a thin fiber towards the nucleus of the
cell. That these centrad continuations of the basal bodies extend to
or past the nucleus I could not determine. Sometimes the basal
bodies with the centrad continuations are pushed quite to one side
of the cell (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>), while in other cells they are applied quite to the
distal surface (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">17</a>, <a href="#plate3">27</a>). <a href="#plate2">Fig. 17</a>, and the part of <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a> that
shows these points, are taken just through the tips of the cells. The
darker lines within the polygonal areas are the intracellular basal
bodies with their centrad continuations, while the thinner lines are
the flagella, and are supposed to lie in the plane just below the
plane of the figure. In those instances in which the centrad continuations
are applied to the distal surface of the cells they could
occasionally be seen to bend centrad (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27b</a>). While these cilia with
their basal bodies and centrad continuations are usually separate, as
shown in the figures, yet they are at times applied quite closely to
each other so that the double nature of the basal bodies and their
centrad continuations is not evident. When the intracellular continuations
of the cilia become pushed to one side or applied to the
distal surface of the cells, I believe this to be due to the turgor of
the cells consequent upon the deposition of large masses of secretion
within them. But I must add that this explanation is not altogether
satisfactory, since in the endoderm cells of the pedalia of
both Charybdea and Tripedalia I found like conditions with no evidence
of a secreting function. (See below, under tentacles.) No one,
to my knowledge, has described the flagellation in detail, although
both Claus and Schewiakoff state that the endoderm is ciliated.</p>

<p>The “floating cells” in the stomach pockets and in the ampulla,
described by Conant, I believe are in part derived from the endothelial
cells of the ampulla. That a portion of them may arise from
the ovary, as Conant explains, I do not doubt; I have, further, found a
mass of floating cells in a small Charybdea quite as Conant describes
for Tripedalia (his Fig. 71). In this Charybdea, however, I could find
no traces of any ovary. Conant speaks of larger and smaller floating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
cells, and that the smaller ones are also found in the males. This
latter fact agrees with what I have suggested, that some of the
floating cells arise in the ampulla. My chief reasons for my supposition,
however, are the following: I find globules of the secretion
of the ampulla cells in some of the floating cells and also scattered
loosely among them (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 19</a>). These globules in and among the
floating cells have the same general appearance and a similar
staining capacity as the secretion in the ampulla cells. Again, in
spaces within some of the ampulla cells I find bodies resembling the
floating cells with lumps of the secretion within them (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 18</a>).
The conclusion, therefore, lies near that some of the floating cells
originate within the cells of the ampulla, engulf within them some
of the secretion, and are then expelled into the lumen of the ampulla.
Better said, perhaps, they represent portions of the ampulla cells
with some of the secretion. I also found several instances in which
a floating cell had the appearance of being expelled from an ampulla
cell. Conant suggests for a similar observation that the cells were
about to be swallowed by the ampulla cells. I believe, however, that
my finding a secretion similar to that within the cells of the
ampulla, in some of the floating cells, as also bodies very much
like them and filled with secretion within the ampulla cells,
together with Conant’s finding floating cells in males, and finally
the observation that the floating cells are usually quite dilapidated,
never showing a healthy cell structure&mdash;all this leads me to conclude
that some of the floating cells originate from the ampulla cells, and
that they have a nutrient function in distributing the secretion.
This is quite the reverse of what Conant supposed,&mdash;that they were
taken in as nourishment by the ampulla cells. I also find what
appears to be a secretion in the endoderm of the tentacles of both
Charybdea and Tripedalia, and believe this is another source of the
floating cells. (See below, under tentacles.)</p>

<p>I also found other very darkly staining bodies (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 19</a>) both
within the floating cells and free in the ampulla cavity, and more
numerous in the ampulla cells themselves. This again goes to show
that floating cells take their origin from the ampulla cells. What
these darkly staining bodies are, I cannot say. Perhaps they are
something akin to the “Chromatoider Nebenkörper” described by
Lenhossek (L), or they represent another kind of secretion. If these
floating cells are derived from the cells of the ampulla, the active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
nuclear division within these also receives an explanation. Some
nuclear matter can usually be observed in the floating cells.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Endothelium of the Peduncle.</i>&mdash;The endothelium of the peduncle
consists of flagellate columnar cells (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>, upper half). The cells
are vacuolated at their bases like some of the cells of the ampulla,
and contain a comparatively large nucleus with nucleolus. The
flagella are long and slender, quite like those described for the cells
of the ampulla, except that there is only one to each cell. The basal
bodies of the flagella are of a peculiar shape. They may be described
as a bent spindle, continuous at their distad ends with the cilia and
at their centrad ends with a fiber that can be traced quite to the
neighborhood of the nucleus. I could not trace these fibers into the
basal parts of the cells, except in one instance, and I could not be
sure of that (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27a</a>).</p>

<p>Another interesting observation in connection with the basal
bodies is that they are bent in one direction on one side of the canal
and in an opposite direction on the other side. In <a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>, which
represents a longitudinal section of the endoderm and the supporting
lamella of the dorsal (<i>i. e.</i> farthest from the eyes) side of the peduncle,
the distal ends of the basal bodies are bent towards the ampulla,
while on the ventral side they would be bent away from the ampulla.
This seems to suggest that the flagella move the contents of the
canal in one direction on the dorsal side of the canal and in an
opposite direction on the ventral side. Conant observed in living
material that bodies in the ampulla and the canal were moving
about, and that bodies within the tentacles were moving in opposite
directions at the same time. This last observation and the histological
facts just described, I believe, are mutually corroborative. Again, <i>a
priori</i>, we should expect some such mechanism as the one described
to bring about an exchange between the contents of the ampulla and
that of the stomach pockets. I have not as yet been able to demonstrate
a similar flagellate mechanism in the tentacles. Flagella and basal
bodies are present in the tentacles, but I could not determine that
the basal bodies had any definite arrangement like that shown in
<a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>. (See under tentacles.) I may add, yet, that the cells in the
canal of the manubrium have cilia, similar to the ones just described,
with large basal bodies, and with centrad continuations. Finally, I
am not certain but that these cells form buds at their ends quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
like those I describe for the endothelial cells of the tentacles (see
below), and that they aid in the formation of the floating cells. I
thought I saw such buds just at the entrance of the lumen of the
peduncle into the ampulla, but could not find conclusive evidence.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Tentacles and the Pedalia.</i>&mdash;My observations on the tentacles
were begun with the object of demonstrating a flagellate mechanism
similar to the one described above for the endothelium of the
peduncle. While I have failed to demonstrate such a mechanism for
the tentacles, yet several interesting points came to my notice. It
will be remembered that the tentacles of the Cubomedusæ are not
directly attached to the bell, but that a blade-like portion, the
pedalium, intervenes between the tentacles and the bell. For figures
of the pedalia and the tentacles the works of Haake, Claus, Conant
and Maas<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#book22">[22]</a></span> may be consulted.</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Ectoderm.</i>&mdash;The ectoderm of the tentacles is the seat of a
number of differentiations. It is quite thick, as the figures (<a href="#plate3">28 and
29</a>) show, and in this respect is very different from the pedalia, on
which the ectoderm cells are quite cubical. I found evidence of cilia
here and there, but I can add nothing definite about them. Neither
can I add any definite statements regarding the ectoderm cells proper,
but what I have to say relates to their differentiations.</p>

<p>(a) The <em>thread cells</em> are of two kinds, larger ones and smaller
ones. This is well shown in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 29</a>, which is part of a transverse
section of a tentacle of Tripedalia. Two kinds of nettle-cells are also
present in the tentacles of Charybdea, but they were specially well
shown in Tripedalia. The structure of these thread-cells seems to be
typical, and I have little more to say about them. I wish, however,
to call attention to the five or six unstriped muscle-fibers that are
attached to their basal lateral parts, and which connect them with
the basement membrane (<a href="#plate3">Figs. 28, 29</a>). Claus describes these muscle-fibers
and mentions that Fr. Müller has described them before him,
but I have not found them mentioned elsewhere in the literature of
nettle-cells. Professor Brooks tells me, however, that he has often
found them. It would appear from <a href="#plate3">Fig. 29</a> that they serve to retract
the thread-cells from the surface. Claus suggests that the muscles
are developed from the cnidoblasts.</p>

<p>(b) The plain subectodermal <em>muscle-fibers</em> are of interest. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Charybdea they lie wholly enclosed within canals of the supporting
lamella (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 32</a>, upper part). They run longitudinally, and near the
base of each tentacle pass out of their canals and become strictly
subectodermal (<a href="#plate3">Figs. 31, 32</a>). This is for Charybdea. In Tripedalia
they rarely come to lie in closed canals as in Charybdea. These
facts show beyond doubt that these muscles are developed from the
ectoderm. Claus has suggested their ectodermal origin, but did not
demonstrate it. He also suggested that they become inclosed in
canals by the supporting lamella pushing up around them and finally
fusing above them. This, I believe, is demonstrated by the conditions
in Tripedalia (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 29</a>). Here the canals usually remain open, but
occasionally, as in the left-hand canal, one may become completely
inclosed. This condition of things suggests the intra-lamellar muscles
found in actiniarians. The nuclei found in the canals with the muscle-fibers
probably belong to the cells from which the muscles become
differentiated. Claus figures these muscle-fibers and nuclei, and it may
be added that the supporting lamella he figures, for C. marsupialis,
is much thicker than I have figured it for C. Xaymacana and
Tripedalia cystophora. The number of muscle-canals also is greater
and occupies a much greater depth of the thickness of the lamella.
Since Claus gives a figure of a transverse section showing the muscles
in their enclosed canals, I have not deemed it necessary to duplicate
his figure. In the transition from a tentacle to a pedalium, the
muscles are most strongly developed toward and at the edges of the
pedalium. This is true for the pedalia in general, and accounts for
the readiness with which they can be bent inwards, as noted in the
physiological part of this paper.</p>

<p>(c) I have found a single <em>ganglion-cell</em> among the cells of the
ectoderm of the tentacles. This showed so plainly that I have figured
it (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 28</a>). Other ganglion-cells no doubt exist, but could probably
not be distinguished from other cells. In its position in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 28</a> it
appears to be associated with the nettle-cell shown just above it. Its
position is very much the same as that figured by Lendenfeld (25a).</p>

<p class="section"><i>The Endoderm.</i>&mdash;The cells of the endoderm of a tentacle are
long and quite slender (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 31</a>). At their bases they are vacuolated
quite like the cells of the ampulla and the canal of the sensory
clubs. They contain a well-formed nucleus with a nucleolus. In
their distal half small light bodies with a dark center are very
evident. These bodies are evidently a secretion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Another peculiar phenomenon presents itself in these cells. The
distal part of each cell becomes separated off from its body by what
appears to be the formation of a transverse cell-wall (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 31</a>, c-d). I
have found the ends of these cells quite separated off in some series.
The formation of the walls seems to begin as a thickening at the sides
of the cells, and a section through this region, transverse to the cells,
would appear like <a href="#plate3">Fig. 30</a>. The dots in the centers of the polygonal
areas of this figure are the centrad continuations of the cilia to be
described below. As already remarked in describing the endoderm
of the ampulla, I believe we here have another place of origin of
the “floating cells.” The secretion just described moves into the
distal parts of the cells prior to their separation (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 31</a>). In some
series I could see these secretion bodies much more numerous within
the distal ends of the cells than in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 31</a>.</p>

<p>As will be seen in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 31</a>, each of the endoderm cells of the
tentacles has a flagellum that extends into the lumen of the tentacle.
Each flagellum has a thickening just within its cell, which may be
regarded as a basal body. From this basal body, again, a small fiber
extends centrad into each cell. It does not appear that the flagella
are thrown off with the distal parts of the cells; at all events, I never
found them connected with any of the floating cells except in a few
doubtful instances.</p>

<p>What I have said for the endoderm of the tentacle of Charybdea
applies equally to Tripedalia.</p>

<p>Claus, in his figure of a transverse section of a tentacle of C.
marsupialis shows the endoderm as cubical. I cannot explain why
there should be such a difference between the endoderm of the
tentacles of <i>C. marsupialis</i> and that of the tentacles of <i>C. Xaymacana</i>
and <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i>. Claus does not describe the endoderm in
detail.</p>

<p>The endoderm cells of the pedalia of both Charybdea and
Tripedalia are cubical and possess flagella, basal bodies, and centrad
continuations, quite like those I have described for the endoderm cells
of the ampulla. The double nature of the basal bodies and the centrad
continuations is, however, not so evident. A secretion I did not find.
Histologically, therefore, the endothelium of the pedalia corresponds
rather with that of the ampulla, and that of the tentacles with that
of the peduncle of the clubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUMMARY.</h3>

<p>The most important results in the histological part of this paper
relate to the structure of the retinas of the eyes of the sensory clubs.</p>

<p>The retina of the distal complex eye is composed of three kinds
of cells: two kinds of sensory cells (the prism and pyramid cells),
and the long pigment cells (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 1-9</a>). The prism and pyramid cells
have each an axial nerve fiber in their prisms and pyramids respectively.
These fibers I could, however, trace only to the neighborhood
of the nuclei. But since I could trace similar fibers in the retinal
cells of the simple eyes (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 16</a>) past the nucleus into the subretinal
nerve tissue, I believe that the axial fibers in question also extend
centrad as nerve fibers into the subretinal nerve tissue. Other observers
also figure such fibers as extending centrad as nerve fibers. The axial
fibers of the prism cells have each a dumbbell-shaped basal body at
their entrance into the pigmented part of a cell. The evidence for a
body of such shape in the pyramid cells was not conclusive, though
a basal body for the axial fiber exists. The long pigment cells project
or retract their pigment in light or darkness respectively and thus
seem to serve to check the diffusion of light in the retina. I have
also supposed that these cells may serve for conducting impulses to
the lens, and that the latter is adjustable.</p>

<p>The proximal complex eye (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>) has only the prism cells
present in its retina, and not two kinds of cells as Schewiakoff has
described (see text, pp. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>, <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, <a href="#Page_63">63</a>) for all the eyes.</p>

<p>The simple eyes (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>), two on each side of a club, four in
all, also have only one kind of cells in their retinas, and each cell
has a flagellum extending into the vitreous secretion of the lumen.
These flagella could be traced centrad as a nerve fiber (<a href="#plate2">Figs. 12, 16</a>).
Similarly, a nerve fiber could be traced centrad from the flagella of
the epithelial cells of the clubs. Dumbbell-shaped basal bodies for
the flagella of the simple eyes could also be demonstrated, but the
evidence for this in the epithelial cells of the clubs was not so
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Other points of interest are: A secretory epithelium lining the
ampulla of the clubs, and a somewhat similar epithelium lining
the canals of the tentacles (Figs. <a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate3">27, 31</a>); the partial origin of the
“floating bodies” in the canals of the clubs and tentacles and the
stomach pockets from these epithelia (<a href="#plate2">Figs. 18, 19</a>); two flagella to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
each cell of the endothelium of the ampulla and of the pedalia (Figs.
<a href="#plate1">7</a>, <a href="#plate2">17</a>); the peculiar nuclei in the endothelial cells of the ampulla
(<a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>); the longitudinal muscles of the tentacles being completely
inclosed within canals of the supporting lamella, but near the base
of a tentacle becoming subectodermal. This demonstrates their
ectodermal origin. In Tripedalia it is seldom that any of these
muscles become enclosed as in Charybdea (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<p>If to the reader my results seem to embody a somewhat heterogeneous
detail, he must remember that the work consists partly
in corroborating and partly in supplementing the work of previous
observers, and that, in general, histological detail does not usually
make the most readable paper.</p>

well, and there might be some doubt that these lighter nuclei belonged to the

noted) which fact can leave no doubt but that some of these nuclei belong to
the pyramid cells. (Similar nuclei, however, are found to belong to the long

<a href="#plate1">6, 8, 9</a>, and <a href="#plate2">21</a> show samples of all the pigmented cells found in macerated
preparations, and none of these (except <a href="#plate1">Fig. 9</a>, long pigment cells) show more
than a single centrad process. Hence, I conclude that centrad both the pyramid
cells and prism cells are continued as a single prolongation.</p>

is only one kind of cells and with axial fibers.</p>

<h2 id="DESCRIPTION_OF_FIGURES">DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES.</h2>

<p class="center">ALL FIGURES, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, ARE FROM CHARYBDEA.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>. This figure represents a transverse section through a portion of the
vitreous body of the distal complex eye at about the level x of <a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a>. Three kinds
of areas are seen, namely, the prisms and pyramids with their axial fibers and the
distal continuations of the long pigment cells. Towards the lower left of the figure
the section is a little more distal than at the right and the transverse areas of the long
pigment cells are no more so large as at the right of the figure. The dark granules in
the areas of the long pigment cells represent pigment. Camera lucida sketch. ×920.
pp. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>, <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, <a href="#Page_54">54</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>. This figure is a camera lucida sketch from a section taken transverse
through the most distal part of the pigmented zone of a slightly pigmented retina of
a distal complex eye. The presence of three kinds of elements is again evident. The
dots without the polygonal areas represent the centrad continuations of the axial fibers
of the prism cells. The lettering explains the other areas. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_50">50</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a>. This is from a section similar to that of <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>, but a little more distal.
At the right, the section is more distal than at the left of the figure, in consequence
of which the long pigment cells are there taken through their distal fibers. Note the
small shrinkage spaces about the axial fibers of the prisms. The white lines bounding
the prism areas appear as in nature. The pyramid cells are not shown in this figure.
×950. Camera sketch. pp. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, <a href="#Page_54">54</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 4</a>. This figure is from a section taken parallel to the long axis of the cells
of the retina of a distal complex eye. It is from a camera sketch, and nothing has
been put into the figure except what could be clearly seen. The lateral boundary
lines of the prisms are not shown. Note the evidence for the existence of three kinds
of cells. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_44">44-52</a>, <a href="#Page_54">54</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 5</a>. This figure represents a sagittal section through the nuclear and
pigmented zones and the subretinal nerve tissue of a slightly pigmented retina of a
distal complex eye, that had been killed in the dark. Camera sketch. The pyramid
cells are not shown. ×900. pp. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, <a href="#Page_53">53</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. These cells are from a preparation by Conant of a sensory club, macerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in acetic acid. Cell a is evidently an iris cell. The others are probably prism cells
from the proximal complex eye. ×900. pp. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>. In this figure I represent a sagittal section through the distal complex
eye. In the middle half of the section, the nuclei, the prism and pyramid cells with
their axial fibers, and the long pigment cells with their large distal fibers are all
strictly camera lucida sketched. A portion of the pigmented zone has been left
unpigmented to better show its structure. At the right and above the concretion
cavity is shown a portion of the endoderm of the ampulla. The section is not strictly
in a dorsoventral plane of the club, in consequence of which the cells of the ampulla
are cut diagonally and through their tips. Note the dumbbell-shaped nuclei of the
ampulla cells, as also the masses of secretion. A part of the retina of the proximal
complex eye is shown in the upper part of the figure. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_41">41-54</a>, <a href="#Page_63">63</a>, <a href="#Page_64">64</a>,
<a href="#Page_68">68-71</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 8</a>. These cells are from a macerated preparation. Cells a, b, c, d may be
either prism or pyramid cells from the distal complex eye or prism cells from the
proximal complex eye. Cells e and f are probably from the right fourth (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>) of
the retina of the proximal complex eye or from the simple eyes. The unlettered
cells are probably from the simple eyes. Some of these show a distal process. ×900.
pp. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_65">65</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 9</a>. The cells here figured are long pigment cells from the same preparation
as <a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. ×900. pp. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_51">51</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 10</a>. This drawing shows an end view of a group of prisms from the same
preparation as <a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. ×900. pp. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate1">Fig. 11</a>. This group of prisms are from the same preparation as <a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. Two of
them are broken off. The fibers seen at the lower end are probably some of the axial
fibers. The fiber at the upper end I believe is interprismatic and the distal fiber of a
long pigment cell. ×900. pp. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 12</a>. This figure is a summary of my results on the simple eyes. It is from a
camera sketch of one of the distal eyes, but somewhat diagrammatic. The left side of
the figure is proximal, the right side distal. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>, <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, <a href="#Page_65">65</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 13</a>. Sagittal dorsoventral section of a proximal complex eye. Conant drew
and published this as his Fig. 69. Conant’s evidence regarding the axial fibers of the
prism cells was incomplete; so that, in this respect, he left his figure unfinished. I
have drawn in these fibers and republish the figure. At the right of the retina and
next the lens (the white space) the vitreous body is incomplete and the fibers from the
retinal cells project freely into the space. This part of the retina also remains
unpigmented. Like my <a href="#plate1">Fig. 7</a>, this figure evidently represents a section somewhat to
one side of a sagittal dorsoventral plane of the club, so that the endoderm cells of
the ampulla are cut diagonally or transversely. pp. <a href="#Page_41">41-44</a>, <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, <a href="#Page_64">64-68</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 14</a>. This is drawn to show how regularly small shrinkage spaces may occur
in transverse sections of the vitreous bodies. This figure is from a transverse section
of the vitreous body of a proximal complex eye. I believe that these spaces are determined
by the axial fibers of the prisms. Prism outlines are not shown. ×950.
pp. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 15</a>. This figure is a drawing of a portion of a transverse section of one of
the simple eyes. Note the flagella from the retinal cells. pp. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 16</a>. The section of the lower left hand corner of this figure is through a portion
of one of the proximal complex eyes, and shows the centrad continuation of the
axial nerve fibers of the retinal cells. The section is such, that, besides the simple
eye, the nuclei of the proximal complex eye (upper part of figure) and two network
cells are cut. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>, <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_63">63</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 17</a>. A transverse section through the tips of the ampulla cells is here shown.
To the left is towards the upper end of the ampulla. The basal bodies with the centrad
fibers are in the plane of the section, while the flagella are supposed to extend
below the plane of the section. ×1350. pp. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 18</a>. These bodies, from within the ampulla cells, contain some of the secretion
of the ampulla cells, and resemble the “floating bodies.” ×1350. pp. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 19</a>. The “floating bodies” here represented are from the ampulla. Globules
of a secretion similar to that found in the ampulla cells are seen both within and
without the bodies. Note also the two black bodies without the cells and two or
three similar ones within the cells. These latter bodies are of doubtful nature.
×1320. pp. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>. This figure represents sections of the various nuclei found within the
ampulla cells. ×1350. pp. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, <a href="#Page_70">70</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 21</a>. These cells are from the same preparation as <a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. They are
evidently retinal cells from the simple eyes. The tendency of their pigmented
ends to become globular, I believe, is due to their having become isolated before
they hardened during maceration. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate2">Fig. 22</a>. This diagram illustrates the retraction of the long pigment cells.
The dotted lines in the vitreous body mark the outlines of the prisms, while
the continuous lines represent the axial fibers of the prism and pyramid cells.
pp. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>, <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, <a href="#Page_53">53</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 23</a>. These cells are from the epithelium of a sensory club. They are
from the same preparation as <a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. Flagella are not shown. ×900. p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 24</a>. This group of epithelial cells of a club are from the same preparation
as <a href="#plate1">Fig. 6</a>. ×850. p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 25</a>. This sketch is a transverse section through the tips of the epithelial
cells of a club. The polygonal areas are the cells, while the central dots
are the centrad continuations (nerve fibers) the flagella of the cells. ×920.
pp. <a href="#Page_63">63</a>, <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, <a href="#Page_66">66</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 26</a>. The flagella of the epithelium of a club are in this figure seen to extend
centrad, some beyond the nuclei. Cell outlines are not shown. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, <a href="#Page_66">66</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 27</a>. The cells of the lower half of this figure belong to the ampulla, those of
the upper half to the canal of the peduncle. The right side of the figure is towards the
eyes (the ventral side) of the club. Globules of secretion are seen within the
ampulla cells, as also a globule without. The ring above the latter globule is
probably an empty shell of a floating cell. ×1320. pp. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, <a href="#Page_71">71</a>, <a href="#Page_73">73</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 28</a>. This figure is from a transverse section of a tentacle of Charybdea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
The mass with darkly stained granules is the remains of a thread cell. The
ectoderm and a small part of the supporting lamella only are figured. Note the
large ganglion cell. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 29</a>. Part of a transverse section of a tentacle of Tripedalia. The endoderm
is not figured. The supporting lamella is seen to be considerably thinner than in
Charybdea. Note the subectodermal muscles, as also the muscle fibers to the thread
cells. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 30</a>. This is a transverse section through the endothelium of a tentacle of
Charybdea in the line c d of <a href="#plate3">Fig. 32</a>. The dark lines bounding the polygonal areas
are the thickenings of the sides of the walls of the cells in the line indicated. The
central dots are the centrad continuations of the flagella. ×920. p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 31</a>. This figure is a transverse section through a tentacle of Charybdea at
about the middle of <a href="#plate3">Fig. 32</a>, <i>i. e.</i> so near to where the tentacle joins the pedalium,
that the muscles within the lamella have all come to lie under the ectoderm. The
ectoderm is not shown. ×920. pp. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>, <a href="#Page_76">76</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#plate3">Fig. 32</a>. A longitudinal section through the supporting lamella only, of a
tentacle of Charybdea, is here shown. In the upper part of the figure the muscle
fibers are seen wholly enclosed by the supporting lamella. In the middle of the figure
they are seen to pass out of their canal. In the lower part of the figure, the supporting
lamella is seen to bend to the right where it becomes continuous with the lamella
of the pedalium. ×920. p. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.</p>

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
